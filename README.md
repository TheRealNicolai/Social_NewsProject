This is our Project about mapping Social News Data from around the world.

The notebook used to create the results in the report is called:
> project_assignment.ipynb

In order to make sure the code runs smoothly, copy the conda-environment from the file:
> conda_environment.yml
using this line:
> conda env create -f conda_environment.yaml
