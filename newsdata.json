        "title": "A Fragile Peace, a Vital Lifeline: Why the Gaza Ceasefire Must Hold",
        "description": "Sorwar Alam is the Chief Reporter & News Publisher at Tu\u0308rkiye\u2019s state-run Anadolu Agency, covering major international issues across Eurasia and the Asia-Pacific region. He has reported extensively from key conflict zones, including the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, as well as the Rohingya crisis, and has significant on-the-ground experience in diplomacy and security. Currently, he leads a team of over 100 journalists and oversees the editorial planning and publishing of international news. c\u110e\u1165\u11ab\u110c\u1175\u110b\u1175\u11af\u1107\u1169.The latest ceasefire in Gaza has brought a faint flicker of hope to a people who have lived through unimaginable devastation. After more than two years of bombardment, displacement, and hunger, Palestinians are clinging to this truce as a breath of relief. Yet, even as we celebrate a pause in the bloodshed, it is impossible to ignore how fragile and uncertain this so-called \u201cpeace deal\u201d really is.As someone who has watched the cycles of violence in Gaza repeat themselves for decades, I cannot help but see this truce as both a lifeline and a warning. It is a lifeline because it may allow the people of Gaza to begin rebuilding what little remains of their lives. But it is also a warning because, without justice and accountability, any ceasefire will crumble like those before it.This deal\u2014brokered with heavy involvement from Tu\u0308rkiye, Egypt, and the United States\u2014rests on unstable ground. The ink may still be drying, but Israeli violations have already begun, and the political divisions across the region are as sharp as ever. Gulf states remain hesitant to commit, and the power imbalance between occupier and occupied persists. Still, for Palestinians, this fragile ceasefire is vitally important.A peace built on sandLet us be honest: this agreement is as vulnerable as the broken walls of Gaza City. It promises peace but leaves the fundamental injustices untouched. The blockade remains in place. The occupation continues. The refugees\u2019 right of return is ignored. The reconstruction process is tied up in political preconditions that serve Israel\u2019s security interests far more than Palestinian survival.Under the so-called \u201cphased withdrawal,\u201d Israel retains heavy security control over much of Gaza. Hamas is expected to disarm, while Israel faces no comparable requirement. There are vague mentions of international oversight but no mechanism to hold Israel accountable when it violates the deal\u2014as it already has, repeatedly.Without guarantees for sovereignty, accountability, and freedom of movement, this truce stands on shifting sand. The absence of trust between the parties, the deep trauma among Gazans, and the economic collapse of the enclave make this peace extremely fragile. The moment Palestinians feel that nothing has changed, resentment will fester again.The biggest risk is that this deal becomes another \u201cpause before the next war.\u201d And if that happens, Gaza will be rebuilt only to be destroyed again.Why the Gulf states are reluctantThe reluctance of Gulf Arab states is striking. Despite their rhetorical support for the Palestinian cause, most have avoided deep engagement with the Gaza crisis beyond humanitarian pledges. Their caution is political, economic, and strategic.Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have invested heavily in ties with Israel and the United States. For them, throwing full support behind Gaza reconstruction could jeopardize these new relationships. They fear that billions spent on rebuilding could vanish with the next round of Israeli bombing\u2014an entirely reasonable fear, given history.Many Gulf leaders also insist that any post-war reconstruction must go through the Palestinian Authority (PA), not Hamas. But Israel opposes that, creating yet another stalemate. Meanwhile, their own domestic agendas\u2014economic diversification, social reforms, and regional realignments\u2014have shifted their priorities inward.For the Gulf, it is easier to issue statements about \u201cArab solidarity\u201d than to take bold action that could antagonize Tel Aviv or Washington. Their reluctance leaves Gaza\u2019s people in limbo: celebrated in speeches, forgotten in budgets.The roles of Tu\u0308rkiye, Egypt, and the United StatesTu\u0308rkiye, Egypt, and the US each played crucial roles in bringing this deal to the table\u2014but their motivations differ.Egypt, as Gaza\u2019s neighbor, remains the key mediator. Cairo hosted the talks, proposed phased reconstruction, and sought to balance humanitarian needs with regional stability. Egypt\u2019s role is pragmatic: it wants to prevent chaos on its border, maintain its diplomatic leverage, and ensure that no new wave of refugees floods into Sinai.Tu\u0308rkiye has taken a more vocal moral stance. Ankara consistently defended Palestinian rights in international forums and pushed for a deal that recognizes Palestinian suffering. While Tu\u0308rkiye\u2019s diplomatic leverage over Israel is limited, its role in rallying Muslim solidarity and shaping global opinion cannot be dismissed.The United States, meanwhile, remains the central power broker. Washington\u2019s fingerprints are all over this agreement, from security arrangements to reconstruction oversight. Without US pressure, Israel would likely never have accepted even this limited ceasefire. But Washington\u2019s approach still reflects its old biases: prioritizing \u201cstability\u201d over justice, \u201csecurity\u201d over sovereignty.This triangle of mediation\u2014Tu\u0308rkiye, Egypt, and the US\u2014may have delivered a ceasefire, but whether they can sustain it depends on political will. If any of them waver, the deal could collapse overnight.2\u110b\u1175\u11af(\u1112\u1167\u11ab\u110c\u1175\u1109\u1175\u1100\u1161\u11ab) \u1100\u1161\u110c\u1161\u110c\u1175\u1100\u116e \u1107\u116e\u11a8\u1107\u116e\u110b\u1174 \u110c\u1161\u1107\u1161\u11af\u1105\u1175\u110b\u1161 \u1102\u1161\u11ab\u1106\u1175\u11ab \u110f\u1162\u11b7\u1111\u1173\u110b\u1166\u1109\u1165 \u1111\u1161\u1100\u116c\u1103\u116c\u11ab \u1100\u1165\u11ab\u1106\u116e\u11af\u110b\u1166 \u110b\u1161\u11ac\u110b\u1161 \u110b\u1175\u11bb\u1102\u1173\u11ab \u1111\u1161\u11af\u1105\u1166\u1109\u1173\u1110\u1161\u110b\u1175\u11ab\u110b\u1175\u11ab. (\u110e\u116e\u11af\u110e\u1165: \u1102\u1172\u1109\u1175\u1109\u1173)Israel\u2019s ongoing violationsIsrael\u2019s actions since the announcement of the truce prove why Palestinians remain skeptical. Despite formal commitments, Israeli forces have continued incursions, arrests, and air surveillance over Gaza. Reconstruction materials are blocked at checkpoints. Aid convoys are delayed. The siege remains in effect, strangling the enclave\u2019s economy and testing its people\u2019s patience.The Israeli government has also publicly opposed any significant role for the Palestinian Authority in Gaza\u2019s future governance\u2014undermining even the US-backed plan. And inside Israel, far-right ministers are openly calling for continued \u201csecurity operations\u201d in Gaza, a euphemism for indefinite control.In short, Israel treats the ceasefire as a tactical pause, not a genuine step toward peace. The message to Palestinians is cruelly familiar: the bombs may stop for now, but the occupation continues.Fragile, yet vital for PalestiniansGiven all these flaws, why does this ceasefire still matter?Because for the people of Gaza, it is the only thin thread of hope left. After months of relentless bombardment that killed tens of thousands and displaced nearly everyone, even a fragile peace is a lifeline. It means hospitals can reopen. Children can sleep without the sound of drones overhead. Families can begin to look for missing loved ones.It is also a political window. For the first time in months, Palestinians have an opportunity\u2014however limited\u2014to shape discussions about their own future. A functioning truce allows for reconstruction, for dialogue about governance, and for rebuilding the institutions that Israel and war have shattered.This ceasefire, if protected, could become a bridge toward something more permanent. It could allow Palestinian civil society to regroup, and regional actors to reassert that the path to real peace must go through justice.But if the ceasefire collapses, the humanitarian catastrophe will deepen beyond imagination. Gaza cannot endure another full-scale assault. The world cannot stand by again and watch hospitals turned to rubble, children buried under debris, and international law mocked with impunity.What the world must doThe international community must not treat this ceasefire as an end, but as a beginning. It must ensure that aid reaches those in need, that the blockade is lifted, and that Israel is held accountable for any violations. Gulf states must move from rhetoric to responsibility\u2014putting real money, real pressure, and real diplomacy behind their words.Most importantly, Palestinians themselves must be placed at the center of any political solution. The world has long talked about Gaza, rarely with Gaza. That must change.For this ceasefire to mean anything, it must pave the way for ending the occupation, restoring sovereignty, and ensuring that no child in Gaza ever again grows up under the shadow of war.The bottom lineThis ceasefire is not peace\u2014it is a pause. It is fragile, imperfect, and one-sided in many ways. But it is also a desperately needed moment for survival and reflection.If it holds, Gaza might begin to heal. If it fails, the world will have once again failed the Palestinian people.As a journalist who has covered too many wars, I can only hope that this time, the world will not look away when Israel tests the limits of this truce. Peace cannot exist without justice, and justice cannot exist under occupation.For now, Gaza breathes\u2014but just barely. And whether that breath becomes life again depends not only on politicians and generals, but on all of us who refuse to let the suffering of Palestinians fade into silence.",

Miniature cosmetics \u2014 also referred to as \u201cpetite\u201d products \u2014 are seeing a surge in popularity as consumers navigate high inflation and sluggish domestic demand, on top of the trend favoring more personalized, experience-based spending. On Nov. 3 afternoon, at the Olive Young branch near Jongno 1-ga in central Seoul, customers were seen browsing through rows of cosmetics, especially pausing in front of mini-sized lipsticks. Some even asked staff whether the store carried miniature versions of other products.

These products are typically sold at half or even one-third the volume of regular items, with correspondingly lower price points, and also allow consumers to try out new products without feeling the pressure to use up a whole product like samples. For example, Banila Co reduced its 30-milliliter (1-ounce) foundation, which retails for 34,000 won ($24), to 14 milliliters for 16,000 won. Another brand, Lilybyred, downsized its 6-gram (0.21-ounce) lip tint to 2.5 grams, cutting the price from 14,000 won to around 8,000 won.

Sales figures reflect this growing trend. According to Ably, one of Hince\u2019s 2-milliliter mini-sized tint products saw a 1,692 percent jump in transaction volume in the third quarter compared to the previous quarter. The company also reported a 611 percent year-on-year increase in searches for \u201clip balm keyrings\u201d last month, highlighting the popularity of keyring-sized beauty items. On Zigzag, a fashion and beauty platform operated by KakaoStyle, searches for mini cosmetics saw a sharp increase from Jan. 1 to Oct. 19 this year. Compared to the same period last year, searches for \u201cmini lipstick\u201d were up 817 percent, \u201cmini shadow\u201d 390 percent, \u201cmini blush\u201d 1,582 percent and \u201cmini perfume\u201d 1,030 percent. On Musinsa Beauty, searches for \u201csmall-sized beauty\u201d and \u201ckeyring tint\u201d rose 245 percent and 1,200 percent, respectively.

        "title": "A Quarter Of Americans Now Believe Political Violence Is Justified",
        "description": "A Quarter Of Americans Now Believe Political Violence Is Justified Authored by Jonathan Turley,We have seen a rise in both rage rhetoric and political violence. New polling shows a shocking level of support for political violence, even after the assassination of Charlie Kirk. A new poll shows roughly a quarter of voters believe political violence is justified with the highest percentage among younger voters.The poll shows that 55 percent of Americans expect political violence to increase with the highest percentage among Harris voters at 61 percent.Younger Americans are the most supportive of political violence. The poll shows that one in three Americans under 45 years old believes that political violence is justified.This tracks with other polling that shows that roughly thirty percent of both Democrats and Republicans felt that political violence might be necessary.The rise in support for political violence comes at a time when politicians are increasingly engaging in violent or rage rhetoric.DNC Chair Ken Martin just told MSNBC\u2019s \u201cThe Beat\u201d that \u201cwe may be nearing\u201d the moment when \u201celections don\u2019t matter and then the resistance looks completely different.\u201d Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called on people to \u201cforcefully rise up.\u201dHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., who pictures himself brandishing a baseball bat has previously called upon people to \u201cfight in the streets.\u201dCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom previously declared, \u201cI\u2019m going to punch these sons of bitches in the mouth.\u201dVirginia Democratic gubernatorial nominee Abigail Spanberger called upon her supporters to \u201cLet your rage fuel you.\u201d She then refused to withdraw her support for the Democratic candidate for Attorney General, Jay Jones, who once expressed his desire to kill his political opponents and his children.In his podcast with co-host Al Hunt, James Carville was again spewing unhinged hate. He returned to treating Trump and others as Nazis and their supporters as \u201ccollaborators.\u201d I previously criticized Carville for that analogy. He later attacked me.Doubling down, Carville declared\u201cYou know what we do with collaborators? I think these corporations, my fantasy dream is that this nightmare ends in 2029 and I think we ought to have radical things. I think they all ought to have their heads shaven, they should be put in orange pajamas and they should be marched down Pennsylvania Avenue and the public should be invited to spit on them.\u201dTo be sure that his menacing words were not lost, he then added \u201cThe universities, the corporations, the law firms, all of these collaborators should be shaved, pajamaed and spit on.\u201dThere was no later pushback by his co-host, Hunt, or anyone else associated with the podcast.Notably, going into today\u2019s election, Jay Jones was still leading in the polls despite saying that he wanted to kill political opponents and their children. Democratic voters were clearly not deterred by such rage rhetoric. Tyler DurdenTue, 11/04/2025 - 17:00",

The Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements and Management's Discussion and Analysis (\"MD&A\") for Q3 2025 and YTD 2025 are available on the REIT's website at www.mintoapartmentreit.com and at www.sedarplus.ca.1 \"We generated continued year-over-year SPP revenue growth in the third quarter, underpinned by the steady growth in unfurnished suite revenue of 2.4% and 10.3% growth in commercial revenue,\" said Jonathan Li, President and Chief Executive Officer of the REIT. \"We achieved this growth despite headwinds from increased supply in certain markets and slowing population growth. We were able to drive occupancy through targeted strategic initiatives and active management, resulting in a sequential increase in closing occupancy to 96.5%. Additionally, we were able to grow Normalized FFO and AFFO per unit, despite the reduction in capitalized interest and lower finance income from the repayment of two CDLs, by carefully managing operating expenses and prudently deploying capital through the NCIB program.\"\"I am also pleased to announce a 2.9% increase to our monthly distributions. This marks the seventh consecutive year that the REIT has increased distributions, having done so in every year following its inception in 2018.\"____________________________1 This news release contains certain non-IFRS and other financial measures, including select information presented on a Proportionate Share Basis to include contributions from an equity-accounted joint venture.

The 55-year-old actor was spotted smiling for selfies, casually dressed with dark sunglasses, before hopping on his bike \u2014 but there\u2019s more going on beneath the surface than just a sunny day in the Big Apple. Deborra-Lee Furness Plans to Tell Her Side of the Story The twist? Hugh\u2019s estranged wife, Australian actress Deborra-Lee Furness, is reportedly gearing up to publish a raw and revealing \u201cdivorce diary.\u201d After officially filing for divorce last month, ending their 27-year marriage, Deborra-Lee seems ready to share the emotional highs and heartbreaking lows of their split. Sources say she\u2019s been meticulously writing down every detail of this difficult journey, determined to have her voice heard. Once the divorce is legally final, she plans to explore publishing deals that will bring her story to the public. A Heartbreaking Public Statement Sparks Interest Deborra-Lee made headlines with a heartfelt public statement where she spoke openly about her \u201ctraumatic journey of betrayal.\u201d She expressed deep empathy for others going through similar pain and reflected on the spiritual strength that\u2019s helped her cope. Her words were thoughtful and introspective, highlighting the wisdom she\u2019s gained and emphasizing the importance of living with integrity and boundaries after such a profound life change. She closed with the idea that \u201cnone of this is personal,\u201d a message that resonated with many but also hinted at underlying tensions. Behind the Scenes, a Memoir Could Shake Things Up While Deborra-Lee is keeping a calm front publicly, insiders reveal she\u2019s preparing to reclaim her narrative through a brutally honest memoir. This book might dive into the intricacies of the split, including Hugh Jackman\u2019s new relationship with Broadway star Sutton Foster. A source close to Deborra-Lee told New Idea that she \u201cwon\u2019t be silenced\u201d and is committed to sharing her truth, which could include revealing details that fans have only speculated about until now. New Romance and Family Tensions Speaking of Sutton Foster, the 50-year-old Broadway star is reportedly feeling the strain as Hugh tries to bring her into the family fold. Hugh and Deborra-Lee share two adopted children, Oscar, 25, and Ava, 19, and sources say Hugh wants Sutton to bond with them \u2014 but Sutton is cautious about moving too fast. According to insiders, Sutton has asked Hugh to slow things down, especially with important family events like Oscar\u2019s recent birthday and Ava\u2019s upcoming one in July. She seems wary of rushing introductions while the divorce remains unsettled and the atmosphere around the family still feels tense. What Lies Ahead for This High-Profile Split? If Deborra-Lee\u2019s memoir comes to fruition, it will likely be one of the most talked-about celebrity books in recent years. With decades of Hollywood experiences, personal struggles, and a headline-making divorce to unpack, publishers are surely eager for the opportunity. Meanwhile, Hugh Jackman has stayed quiet publicly about the split but reportedly feels \u201cextremely disappointed\u201d by Deborra-Lee\u2019s comments. A source revealed there was an unspoken agreement between them not to air their grievances in public \u2014 a promise that now seems broken, albeit without direct name-calling. Hugh Jackman Continues His New York Stage Run Despite the personal turmoil, Hugh has remained professional and engaged with fans during his New York City theatre stint. His ability to balance public appearances with private challenges shows his dedication to his craft \u2014 even as his personal life plays out in the headlines.Breaking Traditions: Miss Universe Welcomes Married Women and Mothers in a Dazzling DisplayCourt Hears Harrowing Testimony: Miss Universe Finalist Attacked by Jealous Ex-Boyfriend in Violent AssaultMiss Universe Model Daniela Nicola\u0301s Reveals Battle with Cervical Cancer in Heartfelt Social Media PostMitchel Ihezue Takes the Crown at Miss Universe Nigeria 2023, Ready to Shine on the Global StageSheynnis Palacios Makes History: Nicaragua\u2019s First Miss Universe 2023Miss Universe Nigeria Mitchel Ihueze Addresses Marriage Rumors and Age SpeculationsMiss Universe Nigeria Chidimma Adetshina responds to allegations of identity theft during South African Home Affairs probeSouth African Beauty Queen Zozibini Tunzi Appointed as Judge for Miss Universe Vietnam 2024, Celebrated for Her Global ImpactMiss Universe First Runner-Up Chidimma Adetshina Breaks Silence Over CEO Anne Jakrajutatip\u2019s \u201cBlonde and Blue Eyes\u201d Evolution CommentAdele interrupts her performance in Las Vegas to reprimand a security guard for arguing with a fan who was \u201cstanding up\u201d at his seat: Why are you all bothering him\u2019 ?Adele interrupts her performance in Las Vegas to reprimand a security guard for arguing with a fan who was \u201cstanding up\u201d at his seat: Why are you all bothering him\u2019 ?New York Woman Sues Miss America and Miss World Pageants for Disqualifying Contestants with Children in Discriminatory MoveChaos Erupts as Active Shooter Causes Panic in Bangkok Shopping CenterBritish Teacher Arrested for Alleged Sexual Abuse of Young Girls at Prestigious Bangkok SchoolDisturbing Incident Unfolds: Passenger Allegedly Attempts Suicide in Aircraft Lavatory during EVA Air Flight from Bangkok to LondonSwiss Air Launches Privacy Investigation After Crew Members Leak Explicit Video of Couple Engaging in Sex Act on Flight 181 from Bangkok to ZurichInfluencer Mark McCann tracks down and recovers his \u00a3220k Lamborghini in Bangkok years after UK car smuggling gang stole itVictoria Beckham Unveils First Menswear Creation on Husband David Beckham During Knighthood Ceremony at Windsor CastleIn the Wake of Autobiographical Storm: Danny Cipriani and Victoria\u2019s Marriage Faces Turbulence, Illuminating the Struggles Between Public Image Control and the Candid TruthTimothy Olyphant Shines in Bangkok While Filming New TV Series and Shows Off Stylish New Look",

        "description": "Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said on Tuesday that the police operation against a powerful criminal faction in Rio that left 121 dead was \"a massacre.\"\"There was a massacre, and I think it's important to verify the conditions under which it occurred,\" Lula said in the Amazon city of Belem during an interview with international news agencies.The police raid last week against the Red Command drug trafficking gang saw thousands of officers battle heavily armed men dressed in camouflage, who dropped explosives on police from drones.Police footage released by local media shows members of the gang gearing up for the fight, with dozens streaming into a forested area where they clashed with elite security forces, and where many of the bodies were found the next day.The battle exposed Rio de Janeiro's chronic security woes and divisions on how to tackle them.While rights activists have denounced harrowing scenes of dead bodies lined up in the street, surveys showed many of the city's crime-weary citizens supported the operation.Felipe Curi, the head of Rio's Civil Police force told reporters on Friday that police had so far identified the bodies of 99 \"criminals\" among the dead \u2013 42 of them subject to arrest warrants and 78 with extensive criminal records.Amid criticism that his administration is too lenient on crime, Lula said on X on Friday that he had submitted a bill to parliament proposing a minimum 30-year prison sentence for gang members.

They demonstrate that by irradiating light of a carefully tuned frequency onto a magnetic metal, one can induce a torque that drives two magnetic layers into a spontaneous, persistent \"chase-and-run\" rotation. This work opens a new frontier in non-equilibrium materials science and suggests novel applications in light-controlled quantum materials.",

        "description": "Immigrant rights and human rights activists have warned for months that federal agents covering up their faces have created a number of problems, including the impersonation of officers. WIRED reported Tuesday that last month, the FBI acknowledged that when U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement cannot be identified and confirmed as legitimate, it gives license to people to pose as officers and nab people. Such was the case when a man claiming to be a sworn officer marched into a Raleigh, North Carolina, motel room and threatened to deport the woman if she did not have sex with him.In a Bay County, Florida case, a woman unzipped her jacket to show an ICE t-shirt and ordered her ex-boyfriend's wife to come with her. The woman grabbed her and took her to an apartment complex before the victim was finally able to escape. In a New York case, a man claimed he was an immigration officer and \"directed [her] to a nearby stairwell,\" WIRED reported. He then punched her, tried to rape her, and took her cell phone. The police ultimately caught him. In other cases, it's unknown if the attackers were, in fact, ICE agents taking advantage of their position or individuals posing as ICE agents. WIRED said that the FBI's notice encouraged agencies to have their officers \"clearly identify themselves and to cooperate when civilians ask to verify an officer\u2019s identity\u2014including by allowing calls to a local police precinct.\"\u201cEnsure law enforcement personnel adequality [sic] identify themselves during operations and cooperate with individuals who request further verification,\u201d the bulletin said.Federal laws mandate that immigration officers identify themselves and state the reason for an arrest. But in video after video of ICE agents grabbing people in Chicago, Portland and Washington, D.C. agents consistently refuse to identify themselves when bystanders request information. In one Chicago case, ICE pepper-sprayed a crowd of people filming them. One officer also pointed a gun at a woman who had her camera phone turned to him. \u201cThe recent increased presence of armed, masked federal officers completely disrupts and erodes public trust in law enforcement,\u201d Alycia Castillo of the Texas Civil Rights Project told WIRED. \u201cFurther, the increase in local cooperation with federal authorities through 287(g) agreements has led to a chilling effect on local law enforcement for communities.\"The 287(g) program \"deputizes local police to act as immigration agents,\" said WIRED. In Chicago, ICE and other federal agents are in unmarked vehicles, and videos show that while many wear clothing that identifies their agency, some do not.",

        "description": "Getty Images / Getty ImagesBrendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz have signed on for a fourth movie in The Mummy franchise, according to a report from Variety\u2014their first together since 2001. The untitled fourth Mummy movie project will be helmed by directors Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett, a creative partnership called \u201cRadio Silence.\u201d The pair are best known for 2019\u2019s Ready or Not and 2022\u2019s Scream. The 1999 version of The Mummy, led by Fraser and Weisz as the romantic leads, was a box office smash, but the IP struggled to maintain momentum in subsequent films. It was followed by 2001\u2019s The Mummy Returns and 2008\u2019s Weisz-less The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor\u2014both failed to capture the box office magic of the original. Similarly, Tom Cruise\u2019s 2017 attempt at a reboot similarly fell flat. Fraser returns to The Mummy during a career renaissance buoyed by his Oscar for his performance in the 2022 movie, The Whale. He previously said he\u2019d be open to returning to The Mummy franchise \u201cif someone came up with the right conceit.\u201d Weisz has remained active in Hollywood, winning awards and nominations for 2019\u2019s The Favorite.Read it at VarietyRead more at The Daily Beast.",

It supports compliance with gambling, KYC/AML, GDPR and CCPA regulations. Independent evaluations of Youverse\u2019s algorithm show high accuracy in age verification, with very low false positives and reliable performance across demographics.The solution is deployable across cloud, edge or on-prem environments and integrates easily into Web, iOS and Android platforms, according to Youverse. The company\u2019s tag line for developers has been \u201c3 lines of code and you\u2019re in.\u201d Youverse is profiled extensively in Biometric Update and Goode Intelligence\u2019s 2025 Online Age Assurance Market Report and Buyer\u2019s Guide.YouLive, the liveness detection API, is built to detect deepfakes and synthetic media with 99.9 percent accuracy, according to the announcement.

Youverse\u2019s Face Liveness adds negligible latency (typically less than one second) and minimal incremental cost to IDV flows, while significantly reducing fraud-related losses, the company says.The system performs reliably across devices and network conditions, with average verification times under two seconds. SDKs are available for major platforms including React Native and Flutter, and the solution features encrypted payloads and tamper-proof session integrity. The company is profiled as one of the pioneers of liveness detection in Biometric Update and Goode Intelligence\u2019s 2025 Face Liveness Market Report and Buyer\u2019s Guide.",

        "description": "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt spun a tall tale during Tuesday\u2019s press briefing when asked about President Donald Trump\u2019s Truth Social rant about Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. The post contradicted his administration\u2019s pledge to partially comply with two federal court orders to fund SNAP during the GOP-created government shutdown. \u201cNo, the administration is fully complying with the court order[s],\u201d Leavitt told reporters. \u201cI just spoke to the president about it. The recipients of these SNAP benefits need to understand it's going to take some time to receive this money, because the Democrats have forced the administration into a very untenable position. We are digging into a contingency fund that is supposed to be for emergencies, catastrophes\u2014for war.\u201dxxYouTube VideoLeavitt went on to claim that Trump\u2014who wrote that SNAP benefits \u201cwill be given only when the Radical Left Democrats open up government\u201d\u2014was actually referring to his reluctance to use emergency funds in the future, not to what he had literally written. \u201cDemocrats are holding it up and making it difficult for the administration to get those payments out the door,\u201d Leavitt added, again shifting blame for the Republican-controlled Congress\u2019 massive cuts to the food assistance program and its ongoing failure to fund the government.",

        "description": "If you\u2019ve noticed some crosswalks in Vancouver behaving differently, you\u2019re not losing your marbles, and there\u2019s a reason behind the changes.Daily Hive Urbanized noticed some changes in the way lights and pedestrian crosswalks behave along Homer Street in recent weeks.The effect of the change is that before the traffic light changes from red to green, the pedestrian light changes first, allowing a pedestrian to walk before allowing the driver to proceed.Here\u2019s how it looks in action:> Some #Vancouver intersections, like Homer and Helmcken, are seeing leading pedestrian interval changes.> > Story incoming. pic.twitter.com/x7Ooqf5Fgo> > \u2014 Amir Ali \u2328\ufe0f\u2615\ufe0f\ud83c\udff4\u200d\u2620\ufe0f (@AmirsDoingItAll) November 4, 2025This change is part of the leading pedestrian intervals (LPI) program implemented by the City of Vancouver.According to some information we received from the City of Vancouver, the first LPI was implemented in 2014 at Davie and Burrard. The pilot was relaunched in 2018 at two locations.\u201cFor the pilot, a video conflict analysis was completed in partnership with UBC. The study showed LPIs have resulted in up to 20 per cent reduction in total conflicts between pedestrians and vehicles and up to 60 per cent reduction in high-severity conflicts between pedestrians and vehicles,\u201d a statement from the City said.Due to positive results from the pilot, the City decided to keep the pilot locations and formalize the program.\u201cCurrently, we complete 30 locations per year. To date, we have installed a total of 98 LPIs,\u201d the City added.According to the City of Vancouver, the LPIs allow pedestrians a three to seven-second head start. Other cities that have seen successful results from LPIs include Surrey and New York.Daily Hive Urbanized shared a little bit about some of the changes relating to LPIs in a story last year.LPIs allow pedestrians to enter the crosswalk a few seconds before vehicles are given a green light, which improves their visibility before vehicles have priority to turn right or left.An approved motion specifically directs City staff to increase the number of pedestrian traffic signals, rapid flashing beacons, and zebra markings and double or triple the number of LPI crossings in the 2023-2026 capital plan. It also explores restricting right turns on red lights at LPI-enabled intersections.Have you noticed the change in any other Vancouver neighbourhoods recently?

        "title": "Old Age Security payments are coming and some Quebec seniors can get over $800 this month",
        "description": "Heads up, Quebec seniors. November brings another Old Age Security payment for taxpayers across the province, and this month's deposit reflects the most recent rate adjustment linked to inflation.OAS payments are managed by Service Canada and provide monthly financial support to Canadians aged 65 and older. These deposits typically arrive during the final week of each month and form a key part of retirement income for millions of seniors.The latest quarterly adjustment took effect in October, which increased OAS amounts to help offset rising living costs. November's payment will reflect those higher rates for the second month in a row.Whether you're already receiving OAS or nearing eligibility, here's what Quebec seniors need to know about November's payment amounts, eligibility, and how the program works.What is Old Age Security?Old Age Security is Canada's main federal pension program for seniors. It pays monthly benefits to eligible residents aged 65 and up, regardless of employment history or past contributions. OAS is separate from the Canada Pension Plan.Most seniors are automatically enrolled, with Service Canada sending a confirmation letter shortly before payments begin.The OAS program also includes additional support for low-income seniors, which may be added on top of the base pension for those who qualify.Who can receive Old Age Security?To qualify for OAS payments, you must:\u2022 Be 65 or older \u2022 Be a Canadian citizen or legal resident at the time your application is approved \u2022 Have lived in Canada for at least 10 years after turning 18If you live outside Canada now, you can still receive OAS if you lived in the country for at least 20 years after turning 18 and were a citizen or legal resident when you left.High-income seniors may have part of their OAS reduced through the OAS recovery tax. For 2025, the clawback begins if your annual income is above $148,541 for those aged 65 to 74, or $154,196 for seniors 75 and older.More about OAS eligibilityHow to apply for OAS paymentsMany Canadians are enrolled in OAS automatically, but not everyone. Most people receive a letter from Service Canada around age 64 that confirms when their payments will begin and outlines their options. If you get this letter, you usually do not need to apply.If you are not enrolled automatically, you will have to submit an application. Payments can begin the month after you turn 65, but you can choose to delay receiving OAS until as late as age 70. Waiting increases the monthly amount for life, since each month of deferral raises your eventual payment.Those who may qualify for linked programs, such as the Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) or other allowances, should know that some of these require a separate application.You can apply for OAS in one of the following ways:\u2022 Online: Through your My Service Canada Account. Have your documents and personal information ready before starting.\u2022 By mail or in person: Fill out the forms for OAS and submit them with the required documents to Service Canada by mail or at a Service Canada office.More about applying for OASHow much is the OAS payment for November?OAS payments are reviewed every January, April, July, and October to help keep pace with inflation. Rates increased by 0.7% this fall.Here are the current maximum monthly OAS amounts:\u2022 Ages 65 to 74: $740.05 \u2022 Ages 75 and over: $814.52These are the maximum amounts. What you receive depends on how long you have lived in Canada. You need 40 years of Canadian residence after age 18 to receive the full amount.More about OAS payment amountsIs OAS taxable?Yes. Old Age Security counts as taxable income in Canada and must be reported at tax time. Service Canada does not automatically withhold taxes, so seniors can request voluntary tax deductions if they prefer smaller tax bills in April.More about OAS and your taxesWhen is the November OAS payment arriving?The next OAS payment will be deposited on Wednesday, November 26, 2025.If you are signed up for direct deposit, it should land in your bank account that day. Cheques may take longer to arrive, and seniors are encouraged to switch to direct deposit to avoid delivery delays.Following November, the final OAS payment of the year will arrive on Monday, December 22, 2025.More about OAS payment dates",

OBBBA also added several new provisions, such as deductions for qualified tip income, qualifying overtime pay, and personal interest on a loan used to purchase a new domestically assembled automotive vehicle, all with limits, of course. Every state that levies an income tax has been studying the impact of OBBBA on their respective income tax codes for months now. Several have already issued reports on that impact and several state legislatures \u2014 especially those with income tax codes that automatically incorporated many, if not most, OBBBA tax changes \u2014 have convened special sessions to determine how to respond.Alabama\u2019s income tax code is a hybrid with respect to federal conformity.

Kennedy Jr during tense exchange on The View in New York after hosts press her on his political roleWhile Hugh Jackman was busy charming fans outside a New York theatre, where he\u2019s starring in Sexual Misconduct of the Middle Classes, his personal life was stirring up quite the storm back home. The 55-year-old actor was spotted smiling for selfies, casually dressed with dark sunglasses, before hopping on his bike \u2014 but there\u2019s more going on beneath the surface than just a sunny day in the Big Apple. Deborra-Lee Furness Plans to Tell Her Side of the Story The twist? Hugh\u2019s estranged wife, Australian actress Deborra-Lee Furness, is reportedly gearing up to publish a raw and revealing \u201cdivorce diary.\u201d After officially filing for divorce last month, ending their 27-year marriage, Deborra-Lee seems ready to share the emotional highs and heartbreaking lows of their split. Sources say she\u2019s been meticulously writing down every detail of this difficult journey, determined to have her voice heard. Once the divorce is legally final, she plans to explore publishing deals that will bring her story to the public. A Heartbreaking Public Statement Sparks Interest Deborra-Lee made headlines with a heartfelt public statement where she spoke openly about her \u201ctraumatic journey of betrayal.\u201d She expressed deep empathy for others going through similar pain and reflected on the spiritual strength that\u2019s helped her cope. Her words were thoughtful and introspective, highlighting the wisdom she\u2019s gained and emphasizing the importance of living with integrity and boundaries after such a profound life change. She closed with the idea that \u201cnone of this is personal,\u201d a message that resonated with many but also hinted at underlying tensions. Behind the Scenes, a Memoir Could Shake Things Up While Deborra-Lee is keeping a calm front publicly, insiders reveal she\u2019s preparing to reclaim her narrative through a brutally honest memoir. This book might dive into the intricacies of the split, including Hugh Jackman\u2019s new relationship with Broadway star Sutton Foster. A source close to Deborra-Lee told New Idea that she \u201cwon\u2019t be silenced\u201d and is committed to sharing her truth, which could include revealing details that fans have only speculated about until now. New Romance and Family Tensions Speaking of Sutton Foster, the 50-year-old Broadway star is reportedly feeling the strain as Hugh tries to bring her into the family fold. Hugh and Deborra-Lee share two adopted children, Oscar, 25, and Ava, 19, and sources say Hugh wants Sutton to bond with them \u2014 but Sutton is cautious about moving too fast. According to insiders, Sutton has asked Hugh to slow things down, especially with important family events like Oscar\u2019s recent birthday and Ava\u2019s upcoming one in July. She seems wary of rushing introductions while the divorce remains unsettled and the atmosphere around the family still feels tense. What Lies Ahead for This High-Profile Split? If Deborra-Lee\u2019s memoir comes to fruition, it will likely be one of the most talked-about celebrity books in recent years. With decades of Hollywood experiences, personal struggles, and a headline-making divorce to unpack, publishers are surely eager for the opportunity. Meanwhile, Hugh Jackman has stayed quiet publicly about the split but reportedly feels \u201cextremely disappointed\u201d by Deborra-Lee\u2019s comments. A source revealed there was an unspoken agreement between them not to air their grievances in public \u2014 a promise that now seems broken, albeit without direct name-calling. Hugh Jackman Continues His New York Stage Run Despite the personal turmoil, Hugh has remained professional and engaged with fans during his New York City theatre stint. His ability to balance public appearances with private challenges shows his dedication to his craft \u2014 even as his personal life plays out in the headlines.Tourists wake up to a fairytale view as hot air balloons rise over the fairy chimneys and stone-carved churches of Go\u0308reme in CappadociaArnold Schwarzenegger reminds co-hosts about the American dream and criticizes illegal immigrant behavior during passionate talk on The View in New YorkMarjorie Taylor Greene agrees to appear on The View in New York after years of tension with its liberal hosts and criticism over lack of conservative guestsRepublican Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene Faces Heated Exchange with Hosts During Appearance on The View in New YorkDonald Trump Defends J.D.

        "description": "Florida\u2019s Office of Insurance Regulation has fined a pair of insurers $250,000 each for how the companies handled claims following hurricanes in 2022 and 2023.The fines against Kin Interinsurance Network and Slide Insurance Co. close out an investigation of 10 companies over the entities' claims-handling operations after Hurricanes Ian in 2022 and Idalia in 2023 that ORI says in a statement resulted \u201cin several findings that violate Florida\u2019s Insurance Code and penalties amounting to\u201d $2.57 million.In September, it fined eight insurers, including three local ones, a total of $2.07 million for how those firms handled claims.The latest $250,000 fines are against two companies with ties to Tampa.Slide is based in Tampa. As for Kin, according to its website Kin Insurance is based in Chicago and Kin Interinsurance has its principal office in St. Petersburg.Among the findings from OIR\u2019s Market Conduct Unit, Kin allegedly failed to provide disclosure statements for both hurricanes and failed to pay or deny claims within 90 days for Hurricane Ian.The findings from regulators contend that in 19.9% of the Ian claims it reviewed, Kin did not include a disclosure statement with the preliminary or partial estimate of damage. And that in 26.9% of the claims reviewed, Kin did not, when providing a payment on a claim that was not the full and final payment, include a disclosure statement.As for Idalia claims, OIR found that in 19.4% of cases Kin also did not include a disclosure statement when providing a payment on a claim that was not the full and final payment.Kin, in a detailed statement from a spokesperson, says that once it was notified of the findings the company worked with OIR to address and correct all of the issues.\u201cThe vast majority of these findings were technical in nature, such as not bolding text that should have been bolded or using disclosure language that did not match the exact required language. A small number of claims exceeded the 90-day processing rule due to delays from third-party vendors,\u201d the spokesperson wrote in the statement.\u201cWe regret the technical discrepancies but are comforted by the fact that none of our errors caused financial harm to our customers, which is the most important factor to Kin.\u201dIn its investigation of Slide, the Market Conduct Unit found that the company used unappointed adjusters and failed to provide disclosure statements for both Hurricanes Ian and Idalia.The finding alleges that after Ian the company did not include disclosure statements when providing preliminary or partial estimate damages in 12.7% of the claims it examined.Investigators also found that in 16.4% of the Ian claims it looked at the company did not include a disclosure statement when providing a payment on a claim that was not the full and final payment.In claims following Idalia, in 12.8% of the claims the unit looked at, Slide used adjusters who were not properly appointed and in 36.9% of the claims examined did not include a disclosure statement when providing a payment on a claim that was not the full and final payment.A spokesperson for Slide says in an email that the company has no further comment.",

        "description": "ISLAMABAD: Pakistan\u2019s abundant solar and wind potential positions it well to transition towards affordable, carbon-free electricity, but weak grid infrastructure remains a major obstacle, a United Nations report has warned.According to the 2025 Review of Climate Ambition in Asia and the Pacific, released by the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UN-ESCAP), Pakistan needs significant investment and coordination to upgrade and expand its grid network to integrate large-scale renewable energy while maintaining system stability.The report says that a successful phase-down of coal in Pakistan will require a comprehensive energy transition plan with clear targets, strong policies and engagement of all stakeholders. The transition, it adds, must be \u201cjust\u201d to avoid disproportionate impacts on workers, businesses and households.Renewable edge over coalThe UN report highlights that solar and wind energy are now cost-competitive with coal, giving Pakistan an opportunity to accelerate its shift towards cleaner energy. Data from the SDG-7 Roadmap for Pakistan show that the Levelised Cost of Electricity (LCOE) for solar and wind generation is significantly lower than that of coal-based power.Solar and wind can cut power costs, but weak infrastructure may slow carbon-free transitionThe energy landscape, the report notes, is evolving as global pressure to cut emissions increases. However, Pakistan\u2019s transition will depend on long-term policy stability, financial support and institutional reforms that encourage private investment in renewables.Regional contextThe report places Pakistan\u2019s situation within a broader Asia-Pacific context, describing the region as being at a \u201ccritical juncture\u201d amid accelerating economic growth and intensifying climate pressures. Economic activity in the region expanded 4.6pc in 2024, contributing 60pc of global GDP growth over the past decade. Yet, rising debt, climate change and biodiversity loss continue to expose countries to mounting risks.Despite these challenges, the Asia-Pacific has maintained its position as a global leader in renewable energy, accounting for 70pc of new capacity additions in 2024. Governments are increasingly adopting net-zero targets, revising climate policies and integrating them into Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to meet emission-reduction goals.Policy and carbon pricing reformsTo translate these commitments into action, countries are reinforcing their legal and regulatory frameworks to attract investment in clean energy. The report says private companies also have a crucial role in implementing deep decarbonisation strategies across their operations and supply chains.The region remains heavily reliant on coal, producing 84pc of the world\u2019s coal-fired power in 2024 and consuming 81.7pc of global coal output in 2023. The UN stresses that phasing down coal will require strong political commitment, removal of fossil fuel subsidies and coordinated policy frameworks to support renewable growth and energy efficiency.Published in Dawn, November 9th, 2025",

Rescue operations were halted on Nov. 8 afternoon after an alarm went off warning the possible risk of another collapse. [YONHAP] A body was recovered at the Ulsan Thermal Power Plant's collapsed boiler tower on Sunday morning, four days after the tower collapsed on Thursday. The worker, a 44-year-old surnamed Kim, is presumed to have died on Friday morning after his arm was trapped in the structure. Two more people, also presumed dead, remain trapped and two are missing. Related ArticleDeadly Ulsan boiler tower collapse raises questions about safety protocols, regulatory blind spotsSearch efforts continue to locate two workers missing from collapsed boiler tower in UlsanThree confirmed dead, two still missing as Ulsan rescue efforts continueUlsan boiler tower collapses, seven workers remain trapped under debris Authorities had halted rescue operations for missing workers at the scene on Saturday afternoon after an alarm went off signaling a potential risk of another collapse. Operations resumed on Sunday, 10:30 a.m., after officials reviewed the safety conditions of resuming. According to the fire authorities and Korea East-West Power, a sensor detecting structural instability was triggered at around 5:25 p.m. on Saturday. Following a loudspeaker evacuation alert, rescue personnel and equipment were immediately withdrawn to a safe zone. Lighting vehicles were also removed from the site. The alarm reportedly came from the collapsed boiler tower of Unit 5. The sensor that was activated is designed to detect shifts in tilt and had been installed by the government's disaster response headquarters to prevent secondary accidents. The company that installed the device is working to determine the cause. \"The overnight rain and the winds raised the risk of peripheral collapsing, making it difficult for us to resume search operations within the structure,\" a fire department official said Sunday. Ulsan saw 18 millimeters (0.7 inches) of rain overnight. Drones were operational since 8:10 a.m. on Sunday morning and 17 personnel were dispatched to the scene since 10:30 a.m. Authorities assess the situation at the Ulsan Power Plant in Ulsan on Nov. 9 after an alarm went off warning the possible risk of another collapse the previous day. [YONHAP] \u201cIt\u2019s unclear at this stage whether the alarm indicated a real threat or was simply a malfunction,\u201d a fire official said. The government response team announced Saturday that it would dismantle Units 4 and 6, located on either side of the collapsed Unit 5. Structural weakening work had already been completed on both units in preparation for demolition, raising concerns that they too could collapse.

FIFA changed the format last year from a biennial event to an annual one to provide more opportunities for young players. North Korean players also dominated the individual awards. Yu Jong-hyang received both the Golden Ball as the tournament's best player and the Golden Boot as the top scorer with eight goals. Kim Won-sim earned the Silver Ball and Silver Boot after scoring seven. North Korea became the second country to win every match en route to the title, following Japan's undefeated run in 2014.",

        "title": "Auto industry gears up for policy battle",
        "description": "KARACHI: As the current auto policy nears its expiry in June 2026, the government is finalising the Auto Industry Policy 2026-31, with the Engineering Development Board (EDB) holding extensive consultations with vehicle assemblers, parts vendors and importers of used vehicles.Officials said the new policy will align with the National Tariff Policy (NTP), introduced under Pakistan\u2019s current $7 billion Extended Fund Facility with the International Monetary Fund, which caps tariff rates on finished goods at 15pc and calls for the removal of concessionary SROs. The move marks a shift towards a more open, market-driven automotive sector.At the same time, the government has allowed the commercial import of used vehicles and is likely to continue baggage and gift schemes for overseas Pakist\u00adanis \u2014 a mechanism local assemblers allege is being misused by traders for commercial imports. The rising influx of used vehicles, often undervalued at customs, has intensified competition for locally assembled models.Assemblers vs parts manufacturersIndustry insiders say a rift has emerged between automakers and parts manufacturers. Nine out of 11 local assemblers \u2014 representing 15 global brands from Japan, China and South Korea \u2014 have jointly proposed lowering duties and taxes to ensure fair competition with used imports, reduce prices and expand the market.New policy to align with IMF-backed tariff reformsThese assemblers suggest capping duties on completely knocked down (CKD) kits and localised parts at 10pc or less, and scrapping duties on safety-related components. They argue that more than 50pc of a vehicle\u2019s price comprises government duties and taxes, making affordability impossible without tariff rationalisation. Localisation, they contend, should only continue where it enhances global competitiveness. In contrast, two major Japa\u00adne\u00ad\u00adse assemblers and several parts manufacturers favour retaining high tariff protection, lobbying for rates as high as 35pc on localised components. Policymakers, however, view this approach as protectionist and counterproductive, saying it has discouraged exports, limited product diversity and allowed outdated models to persist.Officials involved in the policy process said the government has made clear that prolonged protection is no longer sustainable. Ministries have asked long-established assemblers and vendors to justify how decades of localisation have benefited consumers. Despite claims of high local content, many models remain uncompetitive internationally and fall short of global safety and emission standards.Localisation and export gapAccording to Topline Securities, Indus Motor Company (IMC) reported over 60pc localisation in Corolla, Cross and Yaris models, and 40-50pc in Hilux and Revo due to lower volumes. Honda Atlas Cars Ltd (HACL) said localisation stands at over 60pc for Civic, 73pc for City, and below 50pc for BR-V and HR-V. Pak Suzuki Motor Company Ltd (PSMCL) \u2014 delisted from the Pakistan Stock Exchange in 2024 \u2014 had earlier reported localisation of 35pc for Swift, 51pc for Cultus and 62pc for Alto 660cc. Discontinued models such as WagonR, Bolan and Ravi had local content of 61pc, 72pc and 69pc, respectively.Despite these claims, data show that none of these models have recorded significant exports in the past five years, raising questions about the effectiveness of localisation as a development strategy.Diplomatic sources said Japan lodged a WTO complaint against Pakistan\u2019s proposal to link tariff benefits with export performance \u2014 a condition local policymakers argue is necessary to ensure accountability for long-term incentives.New entrants and policy outlookNew entrants in the market have introduced hybrid and plug-in hybrid vehicles, enhanced safety features, and globally competitive designs, while also starting small-scale exports of locally assembled units. Their success has strengthened the case for tariff rationalisation and a level playing field.Analysts note that the current policy has already broken long-standing monopolies and diversified consumer choice. The next phase, they argue, should focus on improving competitiveness rather than continuing protection for legacy players.Published in Dawn, November 9th, 2025",

        "description": "Judges, Democrat Prosecutor Protect Far-Left Activist Who Doxxed & Stalked Stephen Miller Two judges and a Democrat prosecutor are protecting a far-left activist who doxxed top Trump adviser Stephen Miller, then showed up to his house - forcing Miller to evacuate his family to a military base. The case began on Sept. 11, when the suspect, 66-year-old Barbara Wien, was spotted posting flyers in Miller's Arlington neighborhood which included a photo of Miller with a red circle and a cross through it and read \"NO NAZIS IN NOVA,\" according to court records. The flyers included Miller's home address and a QR code linked to the Instagram account of an activist group - Arlington Neighbors United for Umanity (ANUFH).Wien also cased Miller's home - making eye contact with his wife Katie Miller, and allegedly making an \"I'm watching you\" gesture according to a frame grab from a Secret Service surveillance video. This was 24 hours after Charlie Kirk was assassinated - and enough to think Wien had violated Virginia's law against doxxing and a similar federal statute. In response, the FBI sought a warrant for Wein's phone. Yet late Wednesday, Magistrate Judge Lindsey Vaala denied the FBI's petition for a warrant to search Wein's phone a move the Justice Department plans to appeal, Axios reports. The agency wants to examine Wein's phone to see if she lied to investigators, or may be part of a larger group that might pose a risk to Miller and his family. When police seized Wien's phone Oct. 1, she spoke with FBI officials who then alleged that she misled investigators, according to a court filing described to Axios. Based on that, the FBI asked for another search warrant, which Vaala denied.Vaala contributed to the presidential campaigns of Presidents Obama and Biden before her appointment to the bench in 2022. -AxiosAfter Vaala denied the request, the Millers went to Virginia State Police - which took the case to judge Judith Wheat, who authorized the warrant on Oct. 1 - which state and federal law enforcement officials say reflects how routine the request was (and how absurd Vaala's denial was) - yet Democrat prosecutor Parisa Dehghani-Tafti threw a fit, demanding that the Wheat limit the warrant, which she then did in order to limit the search and the sharing of information with the FBI. \"A prosecutor is usually on the same team as the investigators trying to make a case. But in this case, it's the opposite. She's been stymying the investigation, it appears,\" said Richard Cullen, counselor to Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R), who was brought into the case along with Virginia's Attorney General Jason Miyares' office (via Axios). \"In all my years, I've never seen anything like the way this case is being handled,\" said one investigator involved in the case. Of note, Dehghani-Tafti's Facebook page is riddled with anti-Miller postings, and she follows ANUFH - of which Wien is a member. Dehghani-Tafti told Axios that she has \"performed my duties with integrity and objectivity, and I continue to do so. I have acted in every way to uphold the rule of law.\"\"The position of the judge and the justice system in Northern Virginia is, Stephen Miller deserves this, so it shouldn't be investigated,\" a senior administration official told the outlet. Of note, Miller's family isn't the only one that's been evacuated from their house - as several admin officials have been housed on bases amid increasing threats from left-wing political violence. As Axios notes further: Other high-level Trump administration officials also have been moved to bases, a sign of the GOP leaders' alarm about angry protests, the assassination of Charlie Kirk and the assassination attempts on Donald Trump.\"A lot of administration officials feel it's a problem that you have to live in Virginia or D.C. or Maryland. But the criminal justice system will not protect you and your family,\" a White House official said.Bukele was right... Tyler DurdenSat, 11/08/2025 - 21:35",

        "title": "'You violate that oath': GOP senator-physician blasted for supporting Trump insurance plan",
        "description": "U.S. Senator Bill Cassidy, M.D., (R-LA), took heat over the weekend after signaling his support for a Donald Trump plan some experts say could \"kill a whole lot of people.\"Trump over the weekend was met with ridicule after he unleashed a major plan that he said will provide a multibillion dollar payout directly to Americans as an alternative to funding government health care subsidies that have divided lawmakers amid the ongoing government shutdown.\u201cI am recommending to Senate Republicans that the Hundreds of Billions of Dollars currently being sent to money sucking Insurance Companies in order to save the bad Healthcare provided by ObamaCare, BE SENT DIRECTLY TO THE PEOPLE SO THAT THEY CAN PURCHASE THEIR OWN, MUCH BETTER, HEALTHCARE, and have money left over,\u201d Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth Social.Cassidy, a medical doctor, shared Trump's quote on X and added, \"I agree with President Trump! We should give the money directly to the patients.\"That led to outrage from observers.Political scientist Norman Ornstein responded to the comment from Cassidy, saying, \"First, do no harm. You violate that oath every single day. You\u2019re opening up the door to sham plans that will not cover anybody, and reinstate the pre-existing conditions scam. You used to be a good and honest senator.\"\"What happened?\" Ornstein asked.Union communications official Collin Reischman chimed in, \"'We should end subsidies for insurance by taking that exact same amount of money and giving it directly to people to buy insurance' yes masterfully done sir, why didn\u2019t we think of that.\"Virginia city councilman R. Kirk McPike said, \"Replacing insurance with direct cash transfers to people would mean no one but the very rich could ever receive treatment for a chronic condition like heart disease or diabetes or an expensive disease like cancer.\"Columnist Stephanie Grace also weighed in:\"Two things here. 1) Donald Trump knows nothing about the health care industry\u2019s economics. 2) Bill Cassidy does and retweeted this anyway.\"Personal injury attorney James Abrenio also added, \"I'm convinced Trump has no clue how health insurance works but just hates that Obama did something could never come close to accomplishing.\"Healthcare expert Heath Veuleman asked the senator, \"Will physicians be able to offer direct care benefits unbridled by Stark and Antikickback? Will physicians be able to compete with physician-led enterprises? Any ideas on the physician-owned hospital moratorium? Or is all of this just a ploy to divert more taxpayer and consumer spending to hospitals and health systems? Are we going to restore the physician-patient relationship?\"",

        "description": "ISLAMABAD: The standing committees of both houses of parliament on law and justice in a joint session on Saturday cleared nearly 80 per cent of the proposed 27th Constitutional Amendment Bill, including most clauses of the judicial reforms package.But deliberations on field marshal\u2019s status under Article 243 of the Constitution were deferred to Sunday (today).The joint session of the National Assembly and Senate committees was convened under the chairmanship of Senator Farooq H. Naek.Despite a boycott by two members of the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F), Senator Kamran Murtaza and MNA Aliya Kamran, the committee continued its proceedings and examined several key constitutional amendments, particularly those pertaining to the superior judiciary.JUI-F members boycott proceedings; deliberations on field marshal\u2019s status todayThe JUI-F legislators staged a walkout, alleging that provisions previously discarded during the 26th Amendment process were being reintroduced through 27th Amend\u00adm\u00adent, terming the move a \u201cbreach of trust\u201d.Presidential orderThe committees discussed the composition and functioning of the proposed federal constitutional court.According to informed sources, it was decided during the deliberations that the initial strength of the federal court would be determined through a presidential order. However, they said, any subsequent increase in the number of judges would be made through an act of parliament.Judges\u2019 transferThe standing committees in a joint sitting are also likely to finalise the mechanism for the transfer of high court judges through the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) \u2014 a process which may not require the consent of the judges being transferred.Speaking to the media after the session, Senator Naek said that the JUI-F members had boycotted the meeting on the directives of their party leadership.\u201cAfter their departure, the meeting continued. Around 80 per cent of the proposed amendments have been examined.The committee addressed the reservations raised by some members, developed consensus on most points, and resolved ambiguities on several issues,\u201d he said.Field marshal\u2019s statusResponding to a question, he said the committee had not yet discussed Article 243, which would determine the constitutional status of a field marshal, but clarified that the matter would be examined in detail during the clause-by-clause review of the bill. Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar told rep\u00adorters after the meeting that all parliamentary parties were participating in the process and that the government had also \u201crequested the opposition to contribute constructively\u201d. He described the proposed constitutional package as a \u201clong-awaited and comprehensive reform,\u201d noting that it has been under discussion for more than a decade.\u201cAt the time of the 18th Amendment, this issue was part of the broader constitutional agenda. It resurfaced during the 26th Amendment, but could not materialise due to certain political and procedural considerations,\u201d he recalled.Published in Dawn, November 9th, 2025",

        "description": "Bengaluru: A shocking revelation from Bengaluru\u2019s Parappana Agrahara Central Jail has sparked a major political storm in Karnataka after videos surfaced showing a Lashkar terrorist and notorious rapist-murderer Umesh Reddy using mobile phones and enjoying VIP privileges inside the high-security prison. The incident has raised serious concerns about the collapse of the state\u2019s home administration under the Congress government. Retired senior police officer SK Umesh, who served for over 35 years in the Bengaluru Police Department, has expressed deep concern that such lapses are a grave threat to national security. Reacting to the viral videos showing Umesh Reddy using a mobile phone and watching television inside his cell \u2014 and another clip of a Lashkar terrorist scrolling through a smartphone \u2014 Umesh warned that this points to systemic corruption and negligence within the jail system. \u201cThese irregularities are not new, but what is worrying is that no corrective action is being taken. Allowing access to mobile phones and VIP luxuries inside prison walls is dangerous for the country\u2019s security,\u201d he told TV9 Kannada. Umesh further added that jails must serve the purpose of correction and discipline, not luxury and comfort. Also Read: Karnataka: HC dismisses state govt\u2019s appeal against stay on public event permissions; Hearing posted for Nov 13 He has suggested the appointment of an IPS officer as the superintendent of Parappana Agrahara Jail, emphasising that only strong leadership can ensure discipline and accountability. \u201cAt present, the Additional Deputy Commissioner is handling the prison administration, but an IPS-level officer can bring efficiency and control,\u201d he remarked. Despite the Supreme Court\u2019s recent warning in the Darshan case over VIP treatment of prisoners, such incidents continue unabated in Karnataka\u2019s jails. Umesh condemned instances where inmates are allowed to celebrate birthdays with cakes and special meals, calling it a violation of jail rules. \u201cPrison is a place for reform, not recreation,\u201d he said, demanding strict action to restore order. Royal hospitality for terrorist inside prison In a shocking revelation, ISIS recruiter Juhad Hamid Shakeel Manna, one of the most wanted terrorists, has also been reportedly enjoying royal treatment inside Parappana Agrahara. Sources reveal he has been using a smartphone inside the jail without restriction, communicating with outsiders and behaving \u201clike a king.\u201d Terrorist or VIP?

The exposure of his VIP treatment has triggered public anger, with many questioning whether Parappana Agrahara Jail has turned into a safe haven for terrorists and hardened criminals. Videos showing both Umesh Reddy and the Lashkar terrorist using phones have gone viral, prompting citizens to demand accountability from the Siddaramaiah-led government. Opposition lashes out at Congress Leader of the Opposition R. Ashoka launched a scathing attack on the state government, accusing it of turning Parappana Agrahara into a \u201cparadise for terrorists.\u201d Speaking to the media, Ashoka said, \u201cWhen notorious criminals and terrorists are enjoying VIP treatment inside jail, what is the Home Department doing? Has it gone dead?\u201d He alleged that under the Congress government, even those arrested in terrorism-related cases are being given access to phones. \u201cThis government is withdrawing cases against rioters and giving mobile phones to terrorists. The law and order situation has collapsed,\u201d he charged.",

        "description": "ISLAMABAD: The government has presented the country\u2019s first National Industrial Policy (NIP) to the federal cabinet for approval, outlining major constraints to industrial growth and proposing reforms to revitalise the manufacturing sector. However, the Ministry of Finance has asked the Ministry of Industries and Production to first seek the IMF\u2019s clearance for the incentives proposed under the new policy.Officials said a meeting between IMF representatives and a team led by Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Industries and Production Haroon Akhtar Khan is expected later this month to discuss the annual fiscal cost of the incentives planned for various sectors.The policy targets $60 billion in exports by 2030, GDP growth of 6pc and manufacturing growth of 8pc annually by the end of the decade. It aims to provide a roadmap for industrial competitiveness, job creation and export expansion.Key constraintsThe NIP identifies a range of structural and policy-related challenges impeding industrial growth. These include macroeconomic instability, policy uncertainty, costly industrial land, excessive regulation, unreliable and expensive power supply, and limited access to long-term credit.NIP targets $60bn exports by 2030; identifies high costs, weak regulation and uneven taxation as key hurdlesThe ministry said local industries face high borrowing costs and limited access to capital markets. Weak investor protection and an inadequate insolvency framework have further discouraged lending, leaving banks with few tools to restructure loans.The policy notes that uneven taxation across sectors discourages industrial investment. While manufacturing bears a heavier tax burden, sectors such as real estate, construction, wholesale and retail remain undertaxed, reducing returns on industrial ventures.Manufacturing firms also face foreign exchange constraints, with frequent delays in accessing dollars for importing raw materials. In some cases, foreign investors struggle to repatriate profits, deterring foreign direct investment.The NIP highlights weak standards compliance, which hampers exports, and calls for reforms to improve product quality and certification systems. It also stresses the need for inclusive industrialisation, noting that women remain largely excluded from industrial entrepreneurship and management. \u201cWomen remain at the periphery and suffer from a sense of not belonging. This needs to change, and more women industrialists must be promoted,\u201d the document states.The policy proposes a predictable and transparent taxation regime consistent with IMF-backed reforms. It recommends widening the tax net and ensuring that all sectors contribute proportionately to their share of value-added in GDP.The NIP also calls for the review and simplification of corporate income tax (CIT), currently set at 29pc, higher than the regional average of 26pc, which affects export competitiveness. The super tax, levied in addition to the CIT, should also be reassessed to ease the burden on industries, the document says.Structural measuresTo support struggling firms, the policy proposes setting up a National Industrial Revival Commission (NIRC) to oversee company rehabilitation and coordinate regulatory support.It further calls for strengthening intellectual property rights (IPR) through accession to the Patent Cooperation Treaty and enhancing the enforcement capacity of the Intellectual Property Organisation of Pakistan (IPO) to counter counterfeiting and piracy.Reducing port charges, particularly those levied by the Karachi Port Trust (KPT) and Port Qasim Authority (PQA) \u2014 among the highest in the world \u2014 is also recommended to improve export competitiveness.Officials said the policy, once approved, will serve as a framework for industrial transformation through improved governance, fiscal discipline and an enabling environment for private investment. However, its implementation will depend on IMF endorsement of the incentive package, given Pakistan\u2019s commitments under the ongoing economic stabilisation programme.Published in Dawn, November 9th, 2025",

        "description": "\u2022 Article 175 tweak \u2018ends judiciary as we knew it\u2019, says senior counsel\u2022 Supporters believe new constitutional court will modernise judiciaryISLAMABAD: The initial draft of the 27th Constitutional Amendment Bill, ta\u00ad\u00adb\u00adled in the Senate on Saturday, has led many legal experts to believe that the tw\u00ad\u00adeaks would, in effect, dethrone the Sup\u00adr\u00ade\u00ad\u00adme Court as the country\u2019s highest judicial forum, ceding that position to a proposed Federal Constitutional Court (FCC).However, proponents of the amendment say the new constitutional court would modernise the judiciary, reduce backlogs and separate constitutional and appellate jurisdictions \u2014 a reform they argue will improve efficiency and clarity in the justice system.\u201cLeft with a limited jurisdiction of deciding ordinary civil, criminal and statutory appeals, the Supreme Court has now become all the more a \u2018Supreme District Court\u2019,\u201d remarked a senior counsel who asked not to be named.He warned that the government could now amend laws like the Elections Act 2017 and others to route appeals to the FCC instead of the Supreme Court. Amendment to Article 175, he said, was \u201cvirtually the end of the judiciary as we knew it\u201d, arguing that the Supreme Court had been \u201camended out of the Constitution by making it irrelevant\u201d.Former additional attorney general Tariq Mehmood Khokhar said the essence of the package was twofold.First, the insertion of a new Chapter 1A in the Constitution that, in his view, tightens executive control over the superior judiciary through expanded powers to transfer high court judges, and establishes an FCC \u201cempowered by disempowering the Supreme Court\u201d.Second, an amendment to Article 243 that formally vests the office of Chief of the Defence Forces in the Chief of the Army Staff and constitutionally guarantees the Field Marshal rank for life. Another lawyer, also speaking on condition of anonymity, said that although the senior-most of the two chiefs would chair the Judicial Commission of Pakis\u00adtan, \u201cfor all other purposes, the FCC will be in the commanding position\u201d.He pointed out that wherever the oaths of judges of the Supreme Court and FCC are mentioned, the FCC is referenced first. \u201cIt is clear now which court is higher in terms of hierarchy,\u201d he said.He noted that under the amended Article 175A, the chief justice of the FCC is listed before the chief justice of the Supreme Court and will have a longer tenure, retiring at 68, compared to the current retirement age of 65 for Supreme Court judges.\u2018Forward-looking reform model\u2019In contrast, senior counsel Hafiz Ahsaan Ahmad Khokhar welcomed the initiative, calling the proposed 27th Amendment \u201ca major and long-awaited structural shift\u201d in the justice system.He said the creation of two separate apex courts \u2014 the existing Supreme Cou\u00adrt dealing primarily with appellate functions, and a new FCC with exclusive jurisdiction over constitutional interpretation, inter-governmental disputes and matters arising under Article 199 \u2014 ref\u00adlected \u201ca forward-looking reform model\u201d.This division, he argued, would bring Pakistan closer to systems in many established democracies where constitutional and advisory jurisdictions are institutionally distinct, providing \u201cgreater clarity, efficiency and constitutional coherence\u201d.He said the reforms could help depoliticise the higher judiciary, eliminate internal divisions, reduce backlogs and prevent overlapping between constitutional and appellate benches.Mr Khokhar said the amendments to Article 243 were in line with \u201cmodern constitutional democracies\u201d, with a unified advisory framework under a principal military adviser answerable to the prime minister, the defence minister and the National Security Committee.Meanwhile, newly elected Supreme Court Bar Association President Haroonur Rasheed supported the idea of setting up an FCC, and said the association was considering convening an All Pakistan Lawyers Convention, in consultation with the Pakistan Bar Council and other bar bodies. \u201cI am glad that an FCC is being established in the country by amending the Constitution with consensus and unanimity,\u201d he said.Published in Dawn, November 9th, 2025",

        "description": "Arsenal's 10-game winning run came to an end as Brian Brobbey's last-gasp goal gave Sunderland a dramatic 2-2 draw against the Premier League leaders on Saturday.Former Arsenal defender Dan Ballard fired Sunderland ahead with a powerful finish in the 36th minute at the Stadium of Light.That ended the Gunners' run of eight consecutive clean sheets in all competitions.Bukayo Saka levelled with a composed finish in the 54th minute before, Leandro Trossard smashed Arsenal into the lead from the edge of the Sunderland area in the 76th minute.Arsenal were within touching distance of an 11th successive victory in all competitions, but Brobbey stabbed home from Ballard's header to earn a point in the fourth minute of stoppage time.It was the first time they had failed to win in any competition since a 1-1 draw with Manchester City in the top flight on September 21.\"We conceded two similar goals, which is not good enough for ourselves,\" Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta said.\"But it's true that we showed an incredible resilience and courage to come back. Even at the end after we conceded the goal we had a massive chance to win it.\"At the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, Bryan Mbeumo fired Manchester United ahead in the 32nd minute amid mounting discontent among home fans.Booed off at half-time, Tottenham hit back and looked to have secured a dramatic victory after Mathys Tel equalised in the 84th minute and Richarlison deflected in a shot from Wilson Odobert in the 91st minute.But United defender Matthijs de Ligt powered in a 96th-minute header to extend his side's unbeaten run to five games.Tottenham's failure to hold onto the lead was another blow to their dismal record in home league games in 2025, which includes only one win in six top-flight matches in North London this term.Neither manager was satisfied with the outcome and United boss Ruben Amorim said: \"We have so much to grow as a team because today was our day to win. If we have a little bit more bravery, we can kill this game.\"Tottenham manager Thomas Frank added: \"A lot of things we could have done a bit better. The last goal is all about the urgency, maybe don't give the cross away and defend better.\"At Stamford Bridge, Chelsea quelled criticism of Enzo Maresca's rotation policy.Maresca made eight changes against Wolves following their Champions League draw against Azerbaijani minnows Qarabag on Wednesday.French defender Gusto, who arrived from Lyon in 2023, put Chelsea ahead after the interval with his maiden professional goal.Joao Pedro doubled the lead and Pedro Neto wrapped up Chelsea's fourth win in their last five league games.

        "title": "Angat, 4 other Luzon dams open floodgates to release water due to 'Uwan'",
        "description": "MANILA, Philippines \u2013 The Philippine Atmospheric Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (Pagasa) on Tuesday said that five Luzon dams, including Angat, main source of water supply for Metro Manila, continue to release water due to the volume of rainfall from Super Typhoon Uwan that has since left the country.Hydrologist Elmer Caringal, of Pagasa\u2019s Hydrometeorology Division, said that three gates each in Angat and Ipo both in Norzagaray, Bulacan and six each in Ambuklao and Binga dams and five spillway gates in Magat were opened.With its normal high water level (NHWL) at 210 meters (m), Angat's current reservoir water level (RWL) as of 8 a.m., Tuesday, was beyond its NHWL or at 210.90m while Ipo\u2019s RWL was measured at 100.62m against its 101.10 m spilling level.Ambuklao\u2019s water level was at 751.95m, almost near its NHWL of 752m while Binga\u2019s is also near its spilling or overflow level with its RWL at 572.95m against its normal level of 575m, according to Caringal.Located at the boundary between the provinces of Ifugao and Isabela, Magat dam, which has 193m NHWL, is releasing water with an outflow of 2,144.11 cubic meter per second (cms) through its five floodgates with a total opening of nine meters, the national weather bureau said.Saying all concerned local government units as well as village authorities have been properly informed about the opening of floodgates of the dams, Caringal said that residents, especially in Tuguegarao City in Cagayan were experiencing flooding.Caringal said the high volume of rainfall, especially in areas where dams were located, prompted operators to open their gates to prevent overflow or, worse, collapse of dam facilities.",

        "description": "Watching online content is the most frequent way Koreans spend their free time in 2025, with about 80 percent streaming regularly, a survey showed Tuesday. The survey, released by the Ministry of Data and Statistics, also found that fewer people are reading books compared to 10 years ago, with less than half engaging in the activity this year. The 2025 survey, conducted from May 14 to 29, examined welfare, social participation, leisure, income and spending and labor for about 34,000 individuals aged 13 and above in 19,000 households nationwide. The findings come as Koreans live longer and increasingly want to spend their post-retirement years pursuing hobbies, with 42.4 percent of respondents indicating this preference. However, in reality, many spend much of their time on less productive activities. A total of 85.9 percent of respondents reported watching online content on weekdays, compared with 75.6 percent on weekends. With multiple answers allowed, these rates were even higher than those who reported doing nothing and fully resting, which stood at 71.5 percent on weekdays and 71.6 per",

        "description": "Taga\u2019s founder and CEO believes the global popularity of Korean cosmetic products isn\u2019t sustainable, noting that most brands lack a clear philosophy to appeal to international consumers. In addition, Korea\u2019s retail distribution channels are concentrated on just a few major platforms such as CJ Olive Young and Coupang, offering limited choices for both consumers and sellers. Seo Dong-hee completed Taga\u2019s cosmetics lineup in November 2023 and launched sales last year. The Seoul-based company now ships to 19 countries, with a 20th on the way. Despite his short career, he has quickly developed a talent for appealing to international consumers, guided by a simple philosophy: Everything Taga makes must eventually return to the earth in a biodegradable state. For Seo, it is hard to find an active Korean beauty brand with a philosophy as clear and compelling as that of Taga\u2019s. The 48-year-old CEO said most Korean brands remain caught in a marketing skirmish, relying on specific ingredients and promoting them as rejuvenating elixirs. While that strategy may succeed domestically, he wa",

The shift improves efficiency, accuracy and speed, since AI agents are taking over repetitive, time-consuming or information-heavy tasks previously performed by human employees. The insurance sector in particular is experiencing enhanced, faster services, as the AI-reviewed complex insurance consultations reduce mistakes. KB Insurance has launched an AI complaint resolution assistant whereby recorded customer calls are analyzed to classify complaint types before being referred to relevant procedures and department staff. The self-learning AI continuously improves its accuracy, reflecting consumer and employee feedback entered during complaint handling and processing, thereby enhancing response quality, the insurer said. \u201cThe AI-powered consumer service helps speed up the consumer complaint management system, including legal re",

        "description": "Mumbai: As the rumours around the demise of veteran actor Dharmendra flare up, his son, actor Sunny Deol\u2019s team has once again issued a clarification saying the actor continues to be stable.They also urged people not to indulge in spreading rumours.The team said in a statement, \u201cMr. Dharmendra is stable and under observation. Further comments and updates will be shared as available. Kindly don\u2019t indulge in spreading false rumours regarding his health . Request everyone to pray for his speedy recovery and respect the family\u2019s right to privacy\u201d.Earlier, on Monday evening, Dharmendra\u2019s sons, actors Sunny Deol and Bobby Deol visited him. Another Bollywood superstar Salman Khan was also seen arriving at the hospital with heavy security.Bollywood megastar Shah Rukh Khan was also seen arriving at the Breach Candy Hospital in South Mumbai to meet the veteran actor after the latter was admitted.The actor\u2019s Rolls-Royce Cullinan Black Badge was seen arriving at the hospital. The actor\u2019s elder son Aryan Khan was also seen with him paying a visit to the veteran actor.Dharmendra, who was reportedly put on a ventilator, is said to be suffering from breathing difficulties. Dharmendra is one of Bollywood\u2019s most enduring and beloved stars. He was born in 1935 in Punjab, and began his career in the early 1960s, after he was discovered through a talent hunt competition. In the late 1950s, Filmfare magazine, in collaboration with Bimal Roy Productions, organized a nationwide talent contest to find new faces for Hindi cinema.Dharmendra entered the competition and was selected as the winner in 1958, chosen for his striking looks and natural charm. This victory opened the door to the film industry for him. The same talent hunt would later go on to discover Rajesh Khanna, one of Hindi cinema\u2019s biggest superstars.He quickly rose to fame with his charming looks, emotional depth, and effortless screen presence. His versatility allowed him to excel in romance, action, and comedy alike. Some of his most iconic films include \u2018Phool Aur Patthar\u2019, which established him as a leading man, and \u2018Sholay\u2019, where his portrayal of the lovable, witty Veeru became legendary.While \u2018Chupke Chupke\u2019 displayed his impeccable comic timing, action-packed dramas like \u2018Yaadon Ki Baaraat\u2019 solidified his image as the quintessential Bollywood hero. Beyond his cinematic career, Dharmendra\u2019s humility and charisma have made him a cherished figure both on and off screen.(IANS)",

        "title": "'Chopped-up' contracts raise concerns following death of London Bagel Museum worker",
        "description": "Green Party members hold placards during a party address on the death of a London Bagel Museum worker outside the chain\u2019s Anguk branch in Jongno District, central Seoul, on Nov. 3. [YONHAP] When working for a single company, one doesn't expect to constantly be signing employment contracts. That, however, was the reality for one 30-year-old worker \u2014 four contracts in 18 months. Financial difficulties meant the worker was desperate for a renewal each time. The looming end of each contract, every three to six months, was the most nerve-wracking aspect of the job. Related Article93% of surveyed Coupang workers object to KCTU proposal restricting late-night deliveriesCoupang hit with most FTC fines over past 3 years at $114 millionFTC uncovers unfair terms in Coupang Eats and Baemin delivery platforms When asked by a more senior colleague to cover peak shifts on Friday evenings or Saturday afternoons, the worker found it difficult to say no, despite feeling the requests were unfair. The employee often worked an extra hour or two after clocking out during busy periods \u2014 without receiving additional pay. \u201cEvery time it was the month to sign a new contract, I had nightmares that I wouldn\u2019t be rehired and would have to scramble to find a new job,\u201d the worker said. \u201cIt felt like my blood was drying up.\u201d Cases like this have put a spotlight on the widespread practice of repeatedly signing ultra-short-term contracts \u2014 dubbed \u201cchopped-up\u201d contracts \u2014 especially for nonregular workers. The issue gained national attention after a 20-something worker surnamed Jeong, who had been employed at popular bakery chain London Bagel Museum, was suspected to have died from overwork. Critics have pointed to the chain\u2019s reliance on short-term contracts as a contributing factor. Jeong\u2019s family said the employee signed contracts for three, four and seven months, rotating between three store locations over 14 months. London Bagel Museum said the contract terms were based on salary increases linked to promotions and the transfers between stores. Workers load cargo at a Coupang logistics center in Songpa District, southern Seoul. [YONHAP] Not illegal, but \u2018a legal loophole\u2019 Social democratic Justice Party leader Kwon Young-guk issued a statement criticizing the practice. \u201cChopped-up contracts may not be illegal, but they\u2019re a legal loophole that contributes to chronic job insecurity, fostering environments ripe for long working hours and exploitation,\u201d Kwon said. \u201cCoupang\u2019s logistics centers also use a similar model \u2014 contracts split into three-, nine- or 12-month terms \u2014 which creates a constant fear of job loss,\u201d said Kwon. \u201cWorkers say they feel like disposable parts.\u201d For workers repeatedly subjected to short-term contracts, job insecurity isn\u2019t the only concern. They are also more exposed to power abuse and workplace bullying. \u201cIt\u2019s common for workers to endure mistreatment in hopes of renewing their contracts,\u201d said Kim Ki-hong, a labor attorney at labor law firm Dolbloom. \u201cMany tolerate verbal abuse from superiors or work unpaid overtime.\u201d From an employer\u2019s perspective, however, short-term contracts are attractive because they offer greater flexibility. The shorter the term, the easier it is to avoid labor obligations tied to longer employment. Under the Labor Standards Act, workers employed for fewer than three months are not entitled to a 30-day dismissal notice or equivalent pay, meaning employers can terminate them freely. From one year of employment, employers must pay severance and annual leave; after two years, under the Act on the Protection of Fixed-term and Part-time Employees, workers must be converted to permanent status unless the contract is for temporary work. Social democratic Justice Party members hold placards during a press conference outside the Seoul regional office for employment and labor in Jung District, central Seoul, on Nov. 6, calling for measures to prevent another death like the one at London Bagel Museum. [YONHAP] Even public institutions use 'chopped-up' contracts The practice isn\u2019t limited to private companies. Public institutions have also come under scrutiny for using short-term contracts. During a city audit in Gwangju on Thursday, city council member Chae Eun-ji revealed that 171 public sector employees in Gwangju were hired on nine-month contracts and 132 on 11-month contracts. \u201cA nine-month term is a tactic to hire irregular workers for permanent jobs, and 11 months is just a way to dodge obligations toward severance pay,\u201d Chae said. \u201cIt\u2019s disheartening to see this kind of contract trickery in taxpayer-funded public institutions.\u201d The rate at which public corporations converted fixed-term workers to permanent positions dropped from 21.7 percent in 2009 to 14.3 percent in 2021, according to a report by the Korea Labor Institute. Civic groups and lawmakers are increasingly calling for reform. The Justice Party held a press conference on Thursday proposing a new law to prevent ultra-short-term contracts, as well as revisions to the Labor Standards Act to require permanent employment for regular, ongoing tasks. The proposed act would enshrine the right of workers to request contract renewal and prohibit employers from terminating contracts arbitrarily. \u201cWhat\u2019s needed in reality is stronger administrative oversight,\u201d said labor attorney Ok Dong-jin. \u201cThe Labor Ministry needs to supervise and determine whether a job truly requires short-term hiring or if it should be a regular position.\u201d This article was originally written in Korean and translated by a bilingual reporter with the help of generative AI tools.

        "description": "\u2022 Indigenous leaders demand protection for their territories\u2022 Scientists highlight rapid destabilisation of the planet\u2019s frozen regions\u2022 It\u2019s unclear whether states would aim to negotiate a single, final agreement for end of the eventBELEM: The COP30 climate summit opened Monday in this Amazon city with the UN climate chief urging countries to cooperate with one another in the fight against a warming planet rather than battling over competing priorities.Host country Brazil brokered an agreement on the agenda for the two-week summit, fending off attempts from developing-country negotiating blocs to shoehorn contentious issues like climate finance and carbon taxes into the formal talks.The opening day was marked by calls for unity, stark warnings from scientists and Indige\u00adnous groups, and a notable abse\u00adnce by the US federal government that drew sharp criticism from one of its own governors.\u201cIn this arena of COP30, your job here is not to fight one another \u2014 your job here is to fight this climate crisis, together,\u201d UN Climate Change Executive Secretary Simon Stiell told delegates from more than 190 countries attending the conference.Stiell acknowledged that three decades of UN climate talks had helped to bend the curve in projected warming downward, \u201cbecause of what was agreed in halls like this, with governments legislating, and markets responding.\u201dIt remained unclear whether countries would aim to negotiate a single, final agreement for the end of the event \u2014 a hard sell in a year of fractious global politics and US efforts to obstruct a transition away from fossil fuels. Some officials have suggested that countries focus on smaller efforts that do not need universal consensus, after years of COP summits making lofty promises only to leave many unfulfilled.Brazil\u2019s President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva warned against interests trying to obscure the dangers of climate change in his opening remarks.\u201cThey attack the institutions, the science, the universities,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s time to imp\u00adose another defeat to denialists.\u201d The world\u2019s biggest historical emitter of greenhouse gases, the United States, opted to skip the summit at the federal level, while US President Donald Trump asserts that climate change is a hoax.However, a state-level US presence was expected, with California Gov Gavin Newsom and New Mexico Gov Michelle Lujan Grisham scheduled to arrive in Belem on Tuesday.Addressing a global investors summit, Newsom questioned the federal government\u2019s disengagement. \u201cWhat the hell is going on here?\u201d Newsom said about the US government\u2019s absence from the talks.\u201cWe\u2019re in Brazil, one of our great trading partners, one of the world\u2019s great democracies. I mean hell, home to all the rare earth metals we need. This is the country we should be engaging with instead of giving the middle finger with 50 percent tariffs,\u201d Newsom said.European nations planned to use the summit to press for firm commitments. Germany said it would join other European countries to push for commitments to rein in fossil fuel use, a goal also promoted by Lula.Warning signsDelegates were joined by Indigenous leaders, who arri\u00adv\u00aded on Sunday by boat after travelling some 3,000 kilometres (1,864 miles) from the Andes.They are demanding more say in how their territories are managed as climate change escalates and industries such as mining, logging and oil drilling push deeper into forests.\u201cWe want to make sure that they don\u2019t keep promising, that they will start protecting, because we as Indigenous people are the ones who suffer from these impacts of climate change,\u201d said Pablo Inuma Flores, an Indigenous leader from Peru.\u2014ReutersPublished in Dawn, November 11th, 2025",

        "title": "Wall Street Sees Hegseth's Pentagon Procurement Overhaul As \"Wake-Up Call\" For Prime Contractors",
        "description": "Wall Street Sees Hegseth's Pentagon Procurement Overhaul As \"Wake-Up Call\" For Prime Contractors U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's sweeping reforms to secure \"drone domain dominance\" by 2027 are accelerating, following a Reuters report last week that the U.S. Army plans to acquire at least one million drones in the coming years.The initiative, driven by the Pentagon's DOGE modernization team, marks a major shift toward a new generation of lean, agile defense firms, breaking from the legacy industrial-military complex plagued by chronic cost overruns, schedule delays, and ballooning backlogs. Wall Street analysts are calling the pivot a watershed moment for the Pentagon's procurement system, signaling the most significant overhaul of U.S. defense acquisition strategy in decades.According to a memo obtained by Bloomberg News, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is preparing to launch a new \"economic defense unit\" to issue updated contracting guidelines and a \"playbook of modern commercial contract and agreement structures.\"\"These large defense primes need to change to focus on speed and volume, and invest their own capital to get there,\" Hegseth said in a recent speech, adding, \"If they do not, those big ones will fade away.\"Here's a roundup of the latest commentary from Wall Street analysts (courtesy of Bloomberg) offering their take on the Pentagon's sweeping procurement pivot:Bernstein (Douglas S. Harned):Called the speech \"the most aggressive yet\" on defense-acquisition reform, warning that large, established primes may face challenges after years of tailoring their operations to legacy processes. Harned expects newer, commercially oriented defense firms to be near-term winners, given the department's bias toward off-the-shelf, agile solutions.Melius Research (Scott Mikus):Said Hegseth's memo and remarks should serve as a wake-up call for both primes and suppliers. The planned drive to heighten competition threatens to erode the value of proprietary intellectual property that major contractors have long relied on for pricing power.Truist Securities (Michael Ciarmoli):Observed that this time \"feels different,\" citing urgency to field next-generation technology and avoid lagging adversaries. Legacy contractors are \"in the crosshairs,\" while nimble entrants \"sit in the catbird seat.\" The effort will dismantle rigid Pentagon bureaucracy and force the industry to overhaul its own business models.TD Cowen (Roman Schweizer):Noted that Hegseth criticized big primes for cost overruns, schedule slips, and bloated backlogs, urging them to assume more risk and boost internal R&D and capital spending. He concluded that the remarks signal \"significant and sweeping changes\" to weapons development, procurement, and the broader defense-industrial landscape.All the talk about modernizing the Pentagon\u2019s procurement system is very encouraging, but it won\u2019t mean much without a major reshoring or friendshoring of supply chains for critical semiconductors and rare earth minerals, the lifeblood of next-generation drones, fifth-generation attack aircraft, night vision, and the list goes on and on. Without securing these inputs, America\u2019s odds of achieving true battlefield dominance in the 2030s remain up in the air. Time to put reshoring into hyperdrive.

        "description": "JPMorgan stays bullish, sees U.S. government reopening and NVDA earnings as key near-term catalystsJPMorgan strategists reiterated their tactical bullish stance on equities, calling the recent pullback a buying opportunity ahead of several potential tailwinds, including the likely reopening of the U.S. government.In a note to clients, the bank said a resolution to the shutdown would \u201cbuttress current-quarter GDP forecasts\u201d and could release additional liquidity into markets, typically a supportive factor for stocks. Stronger near-term liquidity and improving growth momentum underpinned their constructive view.Another focus is Nvidia\u2019s upcoming earnings, which JPMorgan expects could reassure investors about the durability of the AI-driven growth theme and help sustain this quarter\u2019s revenue and EPS outperformance across the tech sector.The strategists also see the Federal Reserve delivering another 25bp rate cut in December, barring a surprise surge in hiring, while elevated corporate buyback activity should continue to bolster market support.However, JPMorgan cautioned that risks to its view include a miss on Nvidia\u2019s results, an extended government shutdown, weaker-than-expected buyback execution, or a renewed spike in bond volatility and yields. Even so, the bank said overall positioning remains light and retail investor participation subdued \u2014 conditions that could amplify the upside if sentiment turns.

        "description": "\u2022 CJCSC urged troop mobilisation\u2022 COAS cautioned against hasty escalationISLAMABAD: The Natio\u00adnal Secur\u00adity Committee (NSC) did not overrule the then army chief Gen Qamar Bajwa\u2019s response plan during the 2019 Balakot crisis, according to at least two participants of that meeting who spoke on Monday.\u201cThe then army chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa\u2019s response strategy was agreed upon and executed by the Pakistan Air Force,\u201d said a federal minister who attended the meeting, adding that the then chairman of the joint chiefs of staff committee, Gen Zubair Hayat, had proposed a more radical option that was not accepted.An armed forces official who also participated in the meeting gave a similar account, saying that then prime minister Imran Khan was \u201cdispleased\u201d with Gen Hayat\u2019s suggestion, which he thought \u201cdid not make any sense.\u201dThe statements counter a recent claim by former defence secretary Lt Gen (Retd) Asif Yasin Malik, who said that during the 2019 NSC meeting held after the Balakot strikes, Gen Bajwa had advised restraint but was overruled by the air chief and the CJCSC.The 2019 escalation followed a Feb 14 suicide bombing in Pulw\u00adama, India-occupied Kashmir, which killed 40 Indian paramilitary personnel.India responded with airstrikes on Balakot on Feb 26, the first time since the 1971 war that Indian aircraft had crossed deep into Pakistani territory.According to the two participants, who spoke separately to Dawn, the sequence of events began in the early hours of Feb 26, 2019, when then chief of general staff (CGS) Gen Nadeem Raza called Gen Bajwa at about 2:30am to report an Indian airstrike near Balakot.Gen Bajwa asked for an assessment of the damage, and the CGS later informed him that no significant damage had occurred.A seminary built during the Afghan war, used for religious education of local children, had been the intended target.However, the missile missed its mark and landed some distance away, causing no casualties or structural damage.Soon afterwards, the then air chief marshal Mujahid Anwar contacted Gen Bajwa to discuss the situation.Gen Bajwa suggested that since no damage had been caused, the matter could be addressed during a meeting with the prime minister later that morning.Before attending the NSC meeting, Gen Bajwa convened his core team at General Headquarters (GHQ), where the director general of military operations (DGMO) suggested that Pakistan must respond, but in a measured way, to avoid escalation.The DGMO proposed that, unlike India\u2019s night raid on a single site, Pakistan should strike multiple targets in broad daylight to send a clear message and restore deterrence.The response operation, later known as Operation Swift Retort, was conceived during these consultations.Gen Bajwa then took the plan to the National Security Committee meeting at the Prime Minister\u2019s House. During the session, Gen Zubair Hayat spoke for about 40 minutes, emphasising that he was the prime minister\u2019s principal adviser in times of war.When Gen Bajwa asked for his concrete suggestion, Gen Hayat proposed full mobilisation of troops and a declaration of war against India.According to participants, Gen Bajwa cautioned against hasty escalation. He then presented the operational plan prepared at GHQ, which was approved by the NSC. The detailed strategy was subsequently discussed with the PAF chief, who executed the air operation, they recalled.On Feb 27, Pakistani aircraft struck six targets in India-occupied Kashmir, hitting \u201copen spaces\u201d to demonstrate their capability to hit Indian targets without escalating the tensions further.Published in Dawn, November 11th, 2025",
