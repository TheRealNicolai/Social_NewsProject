Currently, he leads a team of over 100 journalists and oversees the editorial planning and publishing of international news. c\u110e\u1165\u11ab\u110c\u1175\u110b\u1175\u11af\u1107\u1169.The latest ceasefire in Gaza has brought a faint flicker of hope to a people who have lived through unimaginable devastation. After more than two years of bombardment, displacement, and hunger, Palestinians are clinging to this truce as a breath of relief. Yet, even as we celebrate a pause in the bloodshed, it is impossible to ignore how fragile and uncertain this so-called \u201cpeace deal\u201d really is.As someone who has watched the cycles of violence in Gaza repeat themselves for decades, I cannot help but see this truce as both a lifeline and a warning. It is a lifeline because it may allow the people of Gaza to begin rebuilding what little remains of their lives. But it is also a warning because, without justice and accountability, any ceasefire will crumble like those before it.This deal\u2014brokered with heavy involvement from Tu\u0308rkiye, Egypt, and the United States\u2014rests on unstable ground. The ink may still be drying, but Israeli violations have already begun, and the political divisions across the region are as sharp as ever. Gulf states remain hesitant to commit, and the power imbalance between occupier and occupied persists. Still, for Palestinians, this fragile ceasefire is vitally important.A peace built on sandLet us be honest: this agreement is as vulnerable as the broken walls of Gaza City. It promises peace but leaves the fundamental injustices untouched. The blockade remains in place. The occupation continues. The refugees\u2019 right of return is ignored. The reconstruction process is tied up in political preconditions that serve Israel\u2019s security interests far more than Palestinian survival.Under the so-called \u201cphased withdrawal,\u201d Israel retains heavy security control over much of Gaza. Hamas is expected to disarm, while Israel faces no comparable requirement. There are vague mentions of international oversight but no mechanism to hold Israel accountable when it violates the deal\u2014as it already has, repeatedly.Without guarantees for sovereignty, accountability, and freedom of movement, this truce stands on shifting sand. The absence of trust between the parties, the deep trauma among Gazans, and the economic collapse of the enclave make this peace extremely fragile. The moment Palestinians feel that nothing has changed, resentment will fester again.The biggest risk is that this deal becomes another \u201cpause before the next war.\u201d And if that happens, Gaza will be rebuilt only to be destroyed again.Why the Gulf states are reluctantThe reluctance of Gulf Arab states is striking. Despite their rhetorical support for the Palestinian cause, most have avoided deep engagement with the Gaza crisis beyond humanitarian pledges. Their caution is political, economic, and strategic.Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have invested heavily in ties with Israel and the United States. For them, throwing full support behind Gaza reconstruction could jeopardize these new relationships. They fear that billions spent on rebuilding could vanish with the next round of Israeli bombing\u2014an entirely reasonable fear, given history.Many Gulf leaders also insist that any post-war reconstruction must go through the Palestinian Authority (PA), not Hamas. But Israel opposes that, creating yet another stalemate. Meanwhile, their own domestic agendas\u2014economic diversification, social reforms, and regional realignments\u2014have shifted their priorities inward.For the Gulf, it is easier to issue statements about \u201cArab solidarity\u201d than to take bold action that could antagonize Tel Aviv or Washington. Their reluctance leaves Gaza\u2019s people in limbo: celebrated in speeches, forgotten in budgets.The roles of Tu\u0308rkiye, Egypt, and the United StatesTu\u0308rkiye, Egypt, and the US each played crucial roles in bringing this deal to the table\u2014but their motivations differ.Egypt, as Gaza\u2019s neighbor, remains the key mediator. Cairo hosted the talks, proposed phased reconstruction, and sought to balance humanitarian needs with regional stability. Egypt\u2019s role is pragmatic: it wants to prevent chaos on its border, maintain its diplomatic leverage, and ensure that no new wave of refugees floods into Sinai.Tu\u0308rkiye has taken a more vocal moral stance. Ankara consistently defended Palestinian rights in international forums and pushed for a deal that recognizes Palestinian suffering. While Tu\u0308rkiye\u2019s diplomatic leverage over Israel is limited, its role in rallying Muslim solidarity and shaping global opinion cannot be dismissed.The United States, meanwhile, remains the central power broker. Washington\u2019s fingerprints are all over this agreement, from security arrangements to reconstruction oversight. Without US pressure, Israel would likely never have accepted even this limited ceasefire. But Washington\u2019s approach still reflects its old biases: prioritizing \u201cstability\u201d over justice, \u201csecurity\u201d over sovereignty.This triangle of mediation\u2014Tu\u0308rkiye, Egypt, and the US\u2014may have delivered a ceasefire, but whether they can sustain it depends on political will. If any of them waver, the deal could collapse overnight.2\u110b\u1175\u11af(\u1112\u1167\u11ab\u110c\u1175\u1109\u1175\u1100\u1161\u11ab) \u1100\u1161\u110c\u1161\u110c\u1175\u1100\u116e \u1107\u116e\u11a8\u1107\u116e\u110b\u1174 \u110c\u1161\u1107\u1161\u11af\u1105\u1175\u110b\u1161 \u1102\u1161\u11ab\u1106\u1175\u11ab \u110f\u1162\u11b7\u1111\u1173\u110b\u1166\u1109\u1165 \u1111\u1161\u1100\u116c\u1103\u116c\u11ab \u1100\u1165\u11ab\u1106\u116e\u11af\u110b\u1166 \u110b\u1161\u11ac\u110b\u1161 \u110b\u1175\u11bb\u1102\u1173\u11ab \u1111\u1161\u11af\u1105\u1166\u1109\u1173\u1110\u1161\u110b\u1175\u11ab\u110b\u1175\u11ab. (\u110e\u116e\u11af\u110e\u1165: \u1102\u1172\u1109\u1175\u1109\u1173)Israel\u2019s ongoing violationsIsrael\u2019s actions since the announcement of the truce prove why Palestinians remain skeptical. Despite formal commitments, Israeli forces have continued incursions, arrests, and air surveillance over Gaza. Reconstruction materials are blocked at checkpoints. Aid convoys are delayed. The siege remains in effect, strangling the enclave\u2019s economy and testing its people\u2019s patience.The Israeli government has also publicly opposed any significant role for the Palestinian Authority in Gaza\u2019s future governance\u2014undermining even the US-backed plan. And inside Israel, far-right ministers are openly calling for continued \u201csecurity operations\u201d in Gaza, a euphemism for indefinite control.In short, Israel treats the ceasefire as a tactical pause, not a genuine step toward peace. The message to Palestinians is cruelly familiar: the bombs may stop for now, but the occupation continues.Fragile, yet vital for PalestiniansGiven all these flaws, why does this ceasefire still matter?Because for the people of Gaza, it is the only thin thread of hope left. After months of relentless bombardment that killed tens of thousands and displaced nearly everyone, even a fragile peace is a lifeline. It means hospitals can reopen. Children can sleep without the sound of drones overhead. Families can begin to look for missing loved ones.It is also a political window. For the first time in months, Palestinians have an opportunity\u2014however limited\u2014to shape discussions about their own future. A functioning truce allows for reconstruction, for dialogue about governance, and for rebuilding the institutions that Israel and war have shattered.This ceasefire, if protected, could become a bridge toward something more permanent. It could allow Palestinian civil society to regroup, and regional actors to reassert that the path to real peace must go through justice.But if the ceasefire collapses, the humanitarian catastrophe will deepen beyond imagination. Gaza cannot endure another full-scale assault. The world cannot stand by again and watch hospitals turned to rubble, children buried under debris, and international law mocked with impunity.What the world must doThe international community must not treat this ceasefire as an end, but as a beginning. It must ensure that aid reaches those in need, that the blockade is lifted, and that Israel is held accountable for any violations. Gulf states must move from rhetoric to responsibility\u2014putting real money, real pressure, and real diplomacy behind their words.Most importantly, Palestinians themselves must be placed at the center of any political solution. The world has long talked about Gaza, rarely with Gaza. That must change.For this ceasefire to mean anything, it must pave the way for ending the occupation, restoring sovereignty, and ensuring that no child in Gaza ever again grows up under the shadow of war.The bottom lineThis ceasefire is not peace\u2014it is a pause. It is fragile, imperfect, and one-sided in many ways. But it is also a desperately needed moment for survival and reflection.If it holds, Gaza might begin to heal. If it fails, the world will have once again failed the Palestinian people.As a journalist who has covered too many wars, I can only hope that this time, the world will not look away when Israel tests the limits of this truce. Peace cannot exist without justice, and justice cannot exist under occupation.For now, Gaza breathes\u2014but just barely. And whether that breath becomes life again depends not only on politicians and generals, but on all of us who refuse to let the suffering of Palestinians fade into silence.", "country": ["south korea"], "category": ["world"], "pubDate": "2025-11-04 22:00:00", "source_id": "newscj", "source_name": "Newscj"}, "edb4c5ebb6a12f56981580bed8a9cf08": {"link": "https://www.syracuse.com/tv/2025/11/cant-watch-the-lowdown-season-finale-on-youtube-tv-try-these-free-alternatives.html", "title": "Can\u2019t watch \u2018The Lowdown\u2019 season finale on YouTube TV?

New polling shows a shocking level of support for political violence, even after the assassination of Charlie Kirk. A new poll shows roughly a quarter of voters believe political violence is justified with the highest percentage among younger voters.The poll shows that 55 percent of Americans expect political violence to increase with the highest percentage among Harris voters at 61 percent.Younger Americans are the most supportive of political violence. The poll shows that one in three Americans under 45 years old believes that political violence is justified.This tracks with other polling that shows that roughly thirty percent of both Democrats and Republicans felt that political violence might be necessary.The rise in support for political violence comes at a time when politicians are increasingly engaging in violent or rage rhetoric.DNC Chair Ken Martin just told MSNBC\u2019s \u201cThe Beat\u201d that \u201cwe may be nearing\u201d the moment when \u201celections don\u2019t matter and then the resistance looks completely different.\u201d Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called on people to \u201cforcefully rise up.\u201dHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., who pictures himself brandishing a baseball bat has previously called upon people to \u201cfight in the streets.\u201dCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom previously declared, \u201cI\u2019m going to punch these sons of bitches in the mouth.\u201dVirginia Democratic gubernatorial nominee Abigail Spanberger called upon her supporters to \u201cLet your rage fuel you.\u201d She then refused to withdraw her support for the Democratic candidate for Attorney General, Jay Jones, who once expressed his desire to kill his political opponents and his children.In his podcast with co-host Al Hunt, James Carville was again spewing unhinged hate. He returned to treating Trump and others as Nazis and their supporters as \u201ccollaborators.\u201d I previously criticized Carville for that analogy. He later attacked me.Doubling down, Carville declared\u201cYou know what we do with collaborators? I think these corporations, my fantasy dream is that this nightmare ends in 2029 and I think we ought to have radical things. I think they all ought to have their heads shaven, they should be put in orange pajamas and they should be marched down Pennsylvania Avenue and the public should be invited to spit on them.\u201dTo be sure that his menacing words were not lost, he then added \u201cThe universities, the corporations, the law firms, all of these collaborators should be shaved, pajamaed and spit on.\u201dThere was no later pushback by his co-host, Hunt, or anyone else associated with the podcast.Notably, going into today\u2019s election, Jay Jones was still leading in the polls despite saying that he wanted to kill political opponents and their children. Democratic voters were clearly not deterred by such rage rhetoric.

A Heartbreaking Public Statement Sparks Interest Deborra-Lee made headlines with a heartfelt public statement where she spoke openly about her \u201ctraumatic journey of betrayal.\u201d She expressed deep empathy for others going through similar pain and reflected on the spiritual strength that\u2019s helped her cope. Her words were thoughtful and introspective, highlighting the wisdom she\u2019s gained and emphasizing the importance of living with integrity and boundaries after such a profound life change. She closed with the idea that \u201cnone of this is personal,\u201d a message that resonated with many but also hinted at underlying tensions. Behind the Scenes, a Memoir Could Shake Things Up While Deborra-Lee is keeping a calm front publicly, insiders reveal she\u2019s preparing to reclaim her narrative through a brutally honest memoir. This book might dive into the intricacies of the split, including Hugh Jackman\u2019s new relationship with Broadway star Sutton Foster. A source close to Deborra-Lee told New Idea that she \u201cwon\u2019t be silenced\u201d and is committed to sharing her truth, which could include revealing details that fans have only speculated about until now. New Romance and Family Tensions Speaking of Sutton Foster, the 50-year-old Broadway star is reportedly feeling the strain as Hugh tries to bring her into the family fold. Hugh and Deborra-Lee share two adopted children, Oscar, 25, and Ava, 19, and sources say Hugh wants Sutton to bond with them \u2014 but Sutton is cautious about moving too fast. According to insiders, Sutton has asked Hugh to slow things down, especially with important family events like Oscar\u2019s recent birthday and Ava\u2019s upcoming one in July. She seems wary of rushing introductions while the divorce remains unsettled and the atmosphere around the family still feels tense. What Lies Ahead for This High-Profile Split? If Deborra-Lee\u2019s memoir comes to fruition, it will likely be one of the most talked-about celebrity books in recent years. With decades of Hollywood experiences, personal struggles, and a headline-making divorce to unpack, publishers are surely eager for the opportunity. Meanwhile, Hugh Jackman has stayed quiet publicly about the split but reportedly feels \u201cextremely disappointed\u201d by Deborra-Lee\u2019s comments. A source revealed there was an unspoken agreement between them not to air their grievances in public \u2014 a promise that now seems broken, albeit without direct name-calling. Hugh Jackman Continues His New York Stage Run Despite the personal turmoil, Hugh has remained professional and engaged with fans during his New York City theatre stint. His ability to balance public appearances with private challenges shows his dedication to his craft \u2014 even as his personal life plays out in the headlines.Breaking Traditions: Miss Universe Welcomes Married Women and Mothers in a Dazzling DisplayCourt Hears Harrowing Testimony: Miss Universe Finalist Attacked by Jealous Ex-Boyfriend in Violent AssaultMiss Universe Model Daniela Nicola\u0301s Reveals Battle with Cervical Cancer in Heartfelt Social Media PostMitchel Ihezue Takes the Crown at Miss Universe Nigeria 2023, Ready to Shine on the Global StageSheynnis Palacios Makes History: Nicaragua\u2019s First Miss Universe 2023Miss Universe Nigeria Mitchel Ihueze Addresses Marriage Rumors and Age SpeculationsMiss Universe Nigeria Chidimma Adetshina responds to allegations of identity theft during South African Home Affairs probeSouth African Beauty Queen Zozibini Tunzi Appointed as Judge for Miss Universe Vietnam 2024, Celebrated for Her Global ImpactMiss Universe First Runner-Up Chidimma Adetshina Breaks Silence Over CEO Anne Jakrajutatip\u2019s \u201cBlonde and Blue Eyes\u201d Evolution CommentAdele interrupts her performance in Las Vegas to reprimand a security guard for arguing with a fan who was \u201cstanding up\u201d at his seat: Why are you all bothering him\u2019 ?Adele interrupts her performance in Las Vegas to reprimand a security guard for arguing with a fan who was \u201cstanding up\u201d at his seat: Why are you all bothering him\u2019 ?New York Woman Sues Miss America and Miss World Pageants for Disqualifying Contestants with Children in Discriminatory MoveChaos Erupts as Active Shooter Causes Panic in Bangkok Shopping CenterBritish Teacher Arrested for Alleged Sexual Abuse of Young Girls at Prestigious Bangkok SchoolDisturbing Incident Unfolds: Passenger Allegedly Attempts Suicide in Aircraft Lavatory during EVA Air Flight from Bangkok to LondonSwiss Air Launches Privacy Investigation After Crew Members Leak Explicit Video of Couple Engaging in Sex Act on Flight 181 from Bangkok to ZurichInfluencer Mark McCann tracks down and recovers his \u00a3220k Lamborghini in Bangkok years after UK car smuggling gang stole itVictoria Beckham Unveils First Menswear Creation on Husband David Beckham During Knighthood Ceremony at Windsor CastleIn the Wake of Autobiographical Storm: Danny Cipriani and Victoria\u2019s Marriage Faces Turbulence, Illuminating the Struggles Between Public Image Control and the Candid TruthTimothy Olyphant Shines in Bangkok While Filming New TV Series and Shows Off Stylish New Look", "country": ["nigeria"], "category": ["entertainment", "top"], "pubDate": "2025-11-04 21:59:19", "source_id": "tdpelmedia", "source_name": "Event Coverage"}, "91951a59930e83c5e1714bd58b4ea730": {"link": "https://edmontonjournal.com/news/local-news/36-million-lotto-649-winner-alberta", "title": "'Holy cow': Whitecourt man wins $36M on Lotto 6/49 Gold Ball draw", "description": "\"I'd really like to do some good with it.

WIRED reported Tuesday that last month, the FBI acknowledged that when U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement cannot be identified and confirmed as legitimate, it gives license to people to pose as officers and nab people. Such was the case when a man claiming to be a sworn officer marched into a Raleigh, North Carolina, motel room and threatened to deport the woman if she did not have sex with him.In a Bay County, Florida case, a woman unzipped her jacket to show an ICE t-shirt and ordered her ex-boyfriend's wife to come with her. The woman grabbed her and took her to an apartment complex before the victim was finally able to escape. In a New York case, a man claimed he was an immigration officer and \"directed [her] to a nearby stairwell,\" WIRED reported. He then punched her, tried to rape her, and took her cell phone. The police ultimately caught him. In other cases, it's unknown if the attackers were, in fact, ICE agents taking advantage of their position or individuals posing as ICE agents. WIRED said that the FBI's notice encouraged agencies to have their officers \"clearly identify themselves and to cooperate when civilians ask to verify an officer\u2019s identity\u2014including by allowing calls to a local police precinct.\"\u201cEnsure law enforcement personnel adequality [sic] identify themselves during operations and cooperate with individuals who request further verification,\u201d the bulletin said.Federal laws mandate that immigration officers identify themselves and state the reason for an arrest. But in video after video of ICE agents grabbing people in Chicago, Portland and Washington, D.C. agents consistently refuse to identify themselves when bystanders request information. In one Chicago case, ICE pepper-sprayed a crowd of people filming them. One officer also pointed a gun at a woman who had her camera phone turned to him. \u201cThe recent increased presence of armed, masked federal officers completely disrupts and erodes public trust in law enforcement,\u201d Alycia Castillo of the Texas Civil Rights Project told WIRED. \u201cFurther, the increase in local cooperation with federal authorities through 287(g) agreements has led to a chilling effect on local law enforcement for communities.\"The 287(g) program \"deputizes local police to act as immigration agents,\" said WIRED.

The pilot was relaunched in 2018 at two locations.\u201cFor the pilot, a video conflict analysis was completed in partnership with UBC. The study showed LPIs have resulted in up to 20 per cent reduction in total conflicts between pedestrians and vehicles and up to 60 per cent reduction in high-severity conflicts between pedestrians and vehicles,\u201d a statement from the City said.Due to positive results from the pilot, the City decided to keep the pilot locations and formalize the program.\u201cCurrently, we complete 30 locations per year. To date, we have installed a total of 98 LPIs,\u201d the City added.According to the City of Vancouver, the LPIs allow pedestrians a three to seven-second head start. Other cities that have seen successful results from LPIs include Surrey and New York.Daily Hive Urbanized shared a little bit about some of the changes relating to LPIs in a story last year.LPIs allow pedestrians to enter the crosswalk a few seconds before vehicles are given a green light, which improves their visibility before vehicles have priority to turn right or left.An approved motion specifically directs City staff to increase the number of pedestrian traffic signals, rapid flashing beacons, and zebra markings and double or triple the number of LPI crossings in the 2023-2026 capital plan. It also explores restricting right turns on red lights at LPI-enabled intersections.Have you noticed the change in any other Vancouver neighbourhoods recently?

November brings another Old Age Security payment for taxpayers across the province, and this month's deposit reflects the most recent rate adjustment linked to inflation.OAS payments are managed by Service Canada and provide monthly financial support to Canadians aged 65 and older. These deposits typically arrive during the final week of each month and form a key part of retirement income for millions of seniors.The latest quarterly adjustment took effect in October, which increased OAS amounts to help offset rising living costs. November's payment will reflect those higher rates for the second month in a row.Whether you're already receiving OAS or nearing eligibility, here's what Quebec seniors need to know about November's payment amounts, eligibility, and how the program works.What is Old Age Security?Old Age Security is Canada's main federal pension program for seniors. It pays monthly benefits to eligible residents aged 65 and up, regardless of employment history or past contributions. OAS is separate from the Canada Pension Plan.Most seniors are automatically enrolled, with Service Canada sending a confirmation letter shortly before payments begin.The OAS program also includes additional support for low-income seniors, which may be added on top of the base pension for those who qualify.Who can receive Old Age Security?To qualify for OAS payments, you must:\u2022 Be 65 or older \u2022 Be a Canadian citizen or legal resident at the time your application is approved \u2022 Have lived in Canada for at least 10 years after turning 18If you live outside Canada now, you can still receive OAS if you lived in the country for at least 20 years after turning 18 and were a citizen or legal resident when you left.High-income seniors may have part of their OAS reduced through the OAS recovery tax. For 2025, the clawback begins if your annual income is above $148,541 for those aged 65 to 74, or $154,196 for seniors 75 and older.More about OAS eligibilityHow to apply for OAS paymentsMany Canadians are enrolled in OAS automatically, but not everyone. Most people receive a letter from Service Canada around age 64 that confirms when their payments will begin and outlines their options. If you get this letter, you usually do not need to apply.If you are not enrolled automatically, you will have to submit an application. Payments can begin the month after you turn 65, but you can choose to delay receiving OAS until as late as age 70. Waiting increases the monthly amount for life, since each month of deferral raises your eventual payment.Those who may qualify for linked programs, such as the Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) or other allowances, should know that some of these require a separate application.You can apply for OAS in one of the following ways:\u2022 Online: Through your My Service Canada Account. Have your documents and personal information ready before starting.\u2022 By mail or in person: Fill out the forms for OAS and submit them with the required documents to Service Canada by mail or at a Service Canada office.More about applying for OASHow much is the OAS payment for November?OAS payments are reviewed every January, April, July, and October to help keep pace with inflation. Rates increased by 0.7% this fall.Here are the current maximum monthly OAS amounts:\u2022 Ages 65 to 74: $740.05 \u2022 Ages 75 and over: $814.52These are the maximum amounts. What you receive depends on how long you have lived in Canada. You need 40 years of Canadian residence after age 18 to receive the full amount.More about OAS payment amountsIs OAS taxable?Yes. Old Age Security counts as taxable income in Canada and must be reported at tax time. Service Canada does not automatically withhold taxes, so seniors can request voluntary tax deductions if they prefer smaller tax bills in April.More about OAS and your taxesWhen is the November OAS payment arriving?The next OAS payment will be deposited on Wednesday, November 26, 2025.If you are signed up for direct deposit, it should land in your bank account that day. Cheques may take longer to arrive, and seniors are encouraged to switch to direct deposit to avoid delivery delays.Following November, the final OAS payment of the year will arrive on Monday, December 22, 2025.More about OAS payment dates", "country": ["canada"], "category": ["business"], "pubDate": "2025-11-04 21:50:46", "source_id": "mtlblog", "source_name": "Mtl Blog"}, "2bc406a2a06d9470b57aa8251d937907": {"link": "https://www.themarketsdaily.com/2025/11/04/clearway-energy-nysecwen-announces-earnings-results.html", "title": "Clearway Energy (NYSE:CWEN) Announces Earnings Results", "description": "Clearway Energy (NYSE:CWEN \u2013 Get Free Report) issued its quarterly earnings results on Tuesday.

Kennedy Jr during tense exchange on The View in New York after hosts press her on his political roleWhile Hugh Jackman was busy charming fans outside a New York theatre, where he\u2019s starring in Sexual Misconduct of the Middle Classes, his personal life was stirring up quite the storm back home. The 55-year-old actor was spotted smiling for selfies, casually dressed with dark sunglasses, before hopping on his bike \u2014 but there\u2019s more going on beneath the surface than just a sunny day in the Big Apple. Deborra-Lee Furness Plans to Tell Her Side of the Story The twist? Hugh\u2019s estranged wife, Australian actress Deborra-Lee Furness, is reportedly gearing up to publish a raw and revealing \u201cdivorce diary.\u201d After officially filing for divorce last month, ending their 27-year marriage, Deborra-Lee seems ready to share the emotional highs and heartbreaking lows of their split. Sources say she\u2019s been meticulously writing down every detail of this difficult journey, determined to have her voice heard. Once the divorce is legally final, she plans to explore publishing deals that will bring her story to the public. A Heartbreaking Public Statement Sparks Interest Deborra-Lee made headlines with a heartfelt public statement where she spoke openly about her \u201ctraumatic journey of betrayal.\u201d She expressed deep empathy for others going through similar pain and reflected on the spiritual strength that\u2019s helped her cope. Her words were thoughtful and introspective, highlighting the wisdom she\u2019s gained and emphasizing the importance of living with integrity and boundaries after such a profound life change. She closed with the idea that \u201cnone of this is personal,\u201d a message that resonated with many but also hinted at underlying tensions. Behind the Scenes, a Memoir Could Shake Things Up While Deborra-Lee is keeping a calm front publicly, insiders reveal she\u2019s preparing to reclaim her narrative through a brutally honest memoir. This book might dive into the intricacies of the split, including Hugh Jackman\u2019s new relationship with Broadway star Sutton Foster. A source close to Deborra-Lee told New Idea that she \u201cwon\u2019t be silenced\u201d and is committed to sharing her truth, which could include revealing details that fans have only speculated about until now. New Romance and Family Tensions Speaking of Sutton Foster, the 50-year-old Broadway star is reportedly feeling the strain as Hugh tries to bring her into the family fold. Hugh and Deborra-Lee share two adopted children, Oscar, 25, and Ava, 19, and sources say Hugh wants Sutton to bond with them \u2014 but Sutton is cautious about moving too fast. According to insiders, Sutton has asked Hugh to slow things down, especially with important family events like Oscar\u2019s recent birthday and Ava\u2019s upcoming one in July. She seems wary of rushing introductions while the divorce remains unsettled and the atmosphere around the family still feels tense. What Lies Ahead for This High-Profile Split? If Deborra-Lee\u2019s memoir comes to fruition, it will likely be one of the most talked-about celebrity books in recent years. With decades of Hollywood experiences, personal struggles, and a headline-making divorce to unpack, publishers are surely eager for the opportunity. Meanwhile, Hugh Jackman has stayed quiet publicly about the split but reportedly feels \u201cextremely disappointed\u201d by Deborra-Lee\u2019s comments. A source revealed there was an unspoken agreement between them not to air their grievances in public \u2014 a promise that now seems broken, albeit without direct name-calling. Hugh Jackman Continues His New York Stage Run Despite the personal turmoil, Hugh has remained professional and engaged with fans during his New York City theatre stint. His ability to balance public appearances with private challenges shows his dedication to his craft \u2014 even as his personal life plays out in the headlines.Tourists wake up to a fairytale view as hot air balloons rise over the fairy chimneys and stone-carved churches of Go\u0308reme in CappadociaArnold Schwarzenegger reminds co-hosts about the American dream and criticizes illegal immigrant behavior during passionate talk on The View in New YorkMarjorie Taylor Greene agrees to appear on The View in New York after years of tension with its liberal hosts and criticism over lack of conservative guestsRepublican Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene Faces Heated Exchange with Hosts During Appearance on The View in New YorkDonald Trump Defends J.D.

As for Kin, according to its website Kin Insurance is based in Chicago and Kin Interinsurance has its principal office in St. Petersburg.Among the findings from OIR\u2019s Market Conduct Unit, Kin allegedly failed to provide disclosure statements for both hurricanes and failed to pay or deny claims within 90 days for Hurricane Ian.The findings from regulators contend that in 19.9% of the Ian claims it reviewed, Kin did not include a disclosure statement with the preliminary or partial estimate of damage. And that in 26.9% of the claims reviewed, Kin did not, when providing a payment on a claim that was not the full and final payment, include a disclosure statement.As for Idalia claims, OIR found that in 19.4% of cases Kin also did not include a disclosure statement when providing a payment on a claim that was not the full and final payment.Kin, in a detailed statement from a spokesperson, says that once it was notified of the findings the company worked with OIR to address and correct all of the issues.\u201cThe vast majority of these findings were technical in nature, such as not bolding text that should have been bolded or using disclosure language that did not match the exact required language. A small number of claims exceeded the 90-day processing rule due to delays from third-party vendors,\u201d the spokesperson wrote in the statement.\u201cWe regret the technical discrepancies but are comforted by the fact that none of our errors caused financial harm to our customers, which is the most important factor to Kin.\u201dIn its investigation of Slide, the Market Conduct Unit found that the company used unappointed adjusters and failed to provide disclosure statements for both Hurricanes Ian and Idalia.The finding alleges that after Ian the company did not include disclosure statements when providing preliminary or partial estimate damages in 12.7% of the claims it examined.Investigators also found that in 16.4% of the Ian claims it looked at the company did not include a disclosure statement when providing a payment on a claim that was not the full and final payment.In claims following Idalia, in 12.8% of the claims the unit looked at, Slide used adjusters who were not properly appointed and in 36.9% of the claims examined did not include a disclosure statement when providing a payment on a claim that was not the full and final payment.A spokesperson for Slide says in an email that the company has no further comment.", "country": ["united states of america"], "category": ["business"], "pubDate": "2025-11-04 21:50:00", "source_id": "businessobserverfl", "source_name": "Business Observer"}, "652e35ff9580a3b5ae4a74dc778ef8d0": {"link": "https://www.duluthnewstribune.com/obituaries/obits/betty-jane-doebbeling-nee-stahl-evotzkvbwraxcxf9nhk6", "title": "Betty Jane Doebbeling (nee Stahl)", "description": "On Monday October 27, Betty Doebbeling passed away at the Minnesota Veterans Home in Silver Bay.Betty was a retired nurse, Vietnam Veteran and recipient of the Bronze NoStar.

The transition, it adds, must be \u201cjust\u201d to avoid disproportionate impacts on workers, businesses and households.Renewable edge over coalThe UN report highlights that solar and wind energy are now cost-competitive with coal, giving Pakistan an opportunity to accelerate its shift towards cleaner energy. Data from the SDG-7 Roadmap for Pakistan show that the Levelised Cost of Electricity (LCOE) for solar and wind generation is significantly lower than that of coal-based power.Solar and wind can cut power costs, but weak infrastructure may slow carbon-free transitionThe energy landscape, the report notes, is evolving as global pressure to cut emissions increases. However, Pakistan\u2019s transition will depend on long-term policy stability, financial support and institutional reforms that encourage private investment in renewables.Regional contextThe report places Pakistan\u2019s situation within a broader Asia-Pacific context, describing the region as being at a \u201ccritical juncture\u201d amid accelerating economic growth and intensifying climate pressures. Economic activity in the region expanded 4.6pc in 2024, contributing 60pc of global GDP growth over the past decade. Yet, rising debt, climate change and biodiversity loss continue to expose countries to mounting risks.Despite these challenges, the Asia-Pacific has maintained its position as a global leader in renewable energy, accounting for 70pc of new capacity additions in 2024. Governments are increasingly adopting net-zero targets, revising climate policies and integrating them into Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to meet emission-reduction goals.Policy and carbon pricing reformsTo translate these commitments into action, countries are reinforcing their legal and regulatory frameworks to attract investment in clean energy. The report says private companies also have a crucial role in implementing deep decarbonisation strategies across their operations and supply chains.The region remains heavily reliant on coal, producing 84pc of the world\u2019s coal-fired power in 2024 and consuming 81.7pc of global coal output in 2023. The UN stresses that phasing down coal will require strong political commitment, removal of fossil fuel subsidies and coordinated policy frameworks to support renewable growth and energy efficiency.Published in Dawn, November 9th, 2025", "country": ["pakistan"], "category": ["top", "business", "environment"], "pubDate": "2025-11-09 02:46:19", "source_id": "dawn", "source_name": "Dawn"}, "e016b770085132b04856500d07c28b29": {"link": "https://nypost.com/2025/11/08/sports/espns-mina-kimes-deeply-embarrassed-after-promoting-solitaire-game/", "title": "ESPN\u2019s Mina Kimes admits she\u2019s \u2018deeply embarrassed\u2019 after promoting solitaire game on social media", "description": "Stephen A.

Rescue operations were halted on Nov. 8 afternoon after an alarm went off warning the possible risk of another collapse. [YONHAP] A body was recovered at the Ulsan Thermal Power Plant's collapsed boiler tower on Sunday morning, four days after the tower collapsed on Thursday. The worker, a 44-year-old surnamed Kim, is presumed to have died on Friday morning after his arm was trapped in the structure. Two more people, also presumed dead, remain trapped and two are missing. Related ArticleDeadly Ulsan boiler tower collapse raises questions about safety protocols, regulatory blind spotsSearch efforts continue to locate two workers missing from collapsed boiler tower in UlsanThree confirmed dead, two still missing as Ulsan rescue efforts continueUlsan boiler tower collapses, seven workers remain trapped under debris Authorities had halted rescue operations for missing workers at the scene on Saturday afternoon after an alarm went off signaling a potential risk of another collapse. Operations resumed on Sunday, 10:30 a.m., after officials reviewed the safety conditions of resuming. According to the fire authorities and Korea East-West Power, a sensor detecting structural instability was triggered at around 5:25 p.m. on Saturday. Following a loudspeaker evacuation alert, rescue personnel and equipment were immediately withdrawn to a safe zone. Lighting vehicles were also removed from the site. The alarm reportedly came from the collapsed boiler tower of Unit 5. The sensor that was activated is designed to detect shifts in tilt and had been installed by the government's disaster response headquarters to prevent secondary accidents. The company that installed the device is working to determine the cause. \"The overnight rain and the winds raised the risk of peripheral collapsing, making it difficult for us to resume search operations within the structure,\" a fire department official said Sunday. Ulsan saw 18 millimeters (0.7 inches) of rain overnight. Drones were operational since 8:10 a.m. on Sunday morning and 17 personnel were dispatched to the scene since 10:30 a.m. Authorities assess the situation at the Ulsan Power Plant in Ulsan on Nov. 9 after an alarm went off warning the possible risk of another collapse the previous day. [YONHAP] \u201cIt\u2019s unclear at this stage whether the alarm indicated a real threat or was simply a malfunction,\u201d a fire official said. The government response team announced Saturday that it would dismantle Units 4 and 6, located on either side of the collapsed Unit 5. Structural weakening work had already been completed on both units in preparation for demolition, raising concerns that they too could collapse.

The move marks a shift towards a more open, market-driven automotive sector.At the same time, the government has allowed the commercial import of used vehicles and is likely to continue baggage and gift schemes for overseas Pakist\u00adanis \u2014 a mechanism local assemblers allege is being misused by traders for commercial imports. The rising influx of used vehicles, often undervalued at customs, has intensified competition for locally assembled models.Assemblers vs parts manufacturersIndustry insiders say a rift has emerged between automakers and parts manufacturers. Nine out of 11 local assemblers \u2014 representing 15 global brands from Japan, China and South Korea \u2014 have jointly proposed lowering duties and taxes to ensure fair competition with used imports, reduce prices and expand the market.New policy to align with IMF-backed tariff reformsThese assemblers suggest capping duties on completely knocked down (CKD) kits and localised parts at 10pc or less, and scrapping duties on safety-related components. They argue that more than 50pc of a vehicle\u2019s price comprises government duties and taxes, making affordability impossible without tariff rationalisation. Localisation, they contend, should only continue where it enhances global competitiveness. In contrast, two major Japa\u00adne\u00ad\u00adse assemblers and several parts manufacturers favour retaining high tariff protection, lobbying for rates as high as 35pc on localised components. Policymakers, however, view this approach as protectionist and counterproductive, saying it has discouraged exports, limited product diversity and allowed outdated models to persist.Officials involved in the policy process said the government has made clear that prolonged protection is no longer sustainable. Ministries have asked long-established assemblers and vendors to justify how decades of localisation have benefited consumers. Despite claims of high local content, many models remain uncompetitive internationally and fall short of global safety and emission standards.Localisation and export gapAccording to Topline Securities, Indus Motor Company (IMC) reported over 60pc localisation in Corolla, Cross and Yaris models, and 40-50pc in Hilux and Revo due to lower volumes. Honda Atlas Cars Ltd (HACL) said localisation stands at over 60pc for Civic, 73pc for City, and below 50pc for BR-V and HR-V. Pak Suzuki Motor Company Ltd (PSMCL) \u2014 delisted from the Pakistan Stock Exchange in 2024 \u2014 had earlier reported localisation of 35pc for Swift, 51pc for Cultus and 62pc for Alto 660cc. Discontinued models such as WagonR, Bolan and Ravi had local content of 61pc, 72pc and 69pc, respectively.Despite these claims, data show that none of these models have recorded significant exports in the past five years, raising questions about the effectiveness of localisation as a development strategy.Diplomatic sources said Japan lodged a WTO complaint against Pakistan\u2019s proposal to link tariff benefits with export performance \u2014 a condition local policymakers argue is necessary to ensure accountability for long-term incentives.New entrants and policy outlookNew entrants in the market have introduced hybrid and plug-in hybrid vehicles, enhanced safety features, and globally competitive designs, while also starting small-scale exports of locally assembled units. Their success has strengthened the case for tariff rationalisation and a level playing field.Analysts note that the current policy has already broken long-standing monopolies and diversified consumer choice.

The case began on Sept. 11, when the suspect, 66-year-old Barbara Wien, was spotted posting flyers in Miller's Arlington neighborhood which included a photo of Miller with a red circle and a cross through it and read \"NO NAZIS IN NOVA,\" according to court records. The flyers included Miller's home address and a QR code linked to the Instagram account of an activist group - Arlington Neighbors United for Umanity (ANUFH).Wien also cased Miller's home - making eye contact with his wife Katie Miller, and allegedly making an \"I'm watching you\" gesture according to a frame grab from a Secret Service surveillance video. This was 24 hours after Charlie Kirk was assassinated - and enough to think Wien had violated Virginia's law against doxxing and a similar federal statute. In response, the FBI sought a warrant for Wein's phone. Yet late Wednesday, Magistrate Judge Lindsey Vaala denied the FBI's petition for a warrant to search Wein's phone a move the Justice Department plans to appeal, Axios reports. The agency wants to examine Wein's phone to see if she lied to investigators, or may be part of a larger group that might pose a risk to Miller and his family. When police seized Wien's phone Oct. 1, she spoke with FBI officials who then alleged that she misled investigators, according to a court filing described to Axios. Based on that, the FBI asked for another search warrant, which Vaala denied.Vaala contributed to the presidential campaigns of Presidents Obama and Biden before her appointment to the bench in 2022. -AxiosAfter Vaala denied the request, the Millers went to Virginia State Police - which took the case to judge Judith Wheat, who authorized the warrant on Oct. 1 - which state and federal law enforcement officials say reflects how routine the request was (and how absurd Vaala's denial was) - yet Democrat prosecutor Parisa Dehghani-Tafti threw a fit, demanding that the Wheat limit the warrant, which she then did in order to limit the search and the sharing of information with the FBI. \"A prosecutor is usually on the same team as the investigators trying to make a case. But in this case, it's the opposite. She's been stymying the investigation, it appears,\" said Richard Cullen, counselor to Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R), who was brought into the case along with Virginia's Attorney General Jason Miyares' office (via Axios). \"In all my years, I've never seen anything like the way this case is being handled,\" said one investigator involved in the case. Of note, Dehghani-Tafti's Facebook page is riddled with anti-Miller postings, and she follows ANUFH - of which Wien is a member. Dehghani-Tafti told Axios that she has \"performed my duties with integrity and objectivity, and I continue to do so. I have acted in every way to uphold the rule of law.\"\"The position of the judge and the justice system in Northern Virginia is, Stephen Miller deserves this, so it shouldn't be investigated,\" a senior administration official told the outlet. Of note, Miller's family isn't the only one that's been evacuated from their house - as several admin officials have been housed on bases amid increasing threats from left-wing political violence. As Axios notes further: Other high-level Trump administration officials also have been moved to bases, a sign of the GOP leaders' alarm about angry protests, the assassination of Charlie Kirk and the assassination attempts on Donald Trump.\"A lot of administration officials feel it's a problem that you have to live in Virginia or D.C. or Maryland. But the criminal justice system will not protect you and your family,\" a White House official said.Bukele was right...

Naek.Despite a boycott by two members of the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F), Senator Kamran Murtaza and MNA Aliya Kamran, the committee continued its proceedings and examined several key constitutional amendments, particularly those pertaining to the superior judiciary.JUI-F members boycott proceedings; deliberations on field marshal\u2019s status todayThe JUI-F legislators staged a walkout, alleging that provisions previously discarded during the 26th Amendment process were being reintroduced through 27th Amend\u00adm\u00adent, terming the move a \u201cbreach of trust\u201d.Presidential orderThe committees discussed the composition and functioning of the proposed federal constitutional court.According to informed sources, it was decided during the deliberations that the initial strength of the federal court would be determined through a presidential order. However, they said, any subsequent increase in the number of judges would be made through an act of parliament.Judges\u2019 transferThe standing committees in a joint sitting are also likely to finalise the mechanism for the transfer of high court judges through the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) \u2014 a process which may not require the consent of the judges being transferred.Speaking to the media after the session, Senator Naek said that the JUI-F members had boycotted the meeting on the directives of their party leadership.\u201cAfter their departure, the meeting continued. Around 80 per cent of the proposed amendments have been examined.The committee addressed the reservations raised by some members, developed consensus on most points, and resolved ambiguities on several issues,\u201d he said.Field marshal\u2019s statusResponding to a question, he said the committee had not yet discussed Article 243, which would determine the constitutional status of a field marshal, but clarified that the matter would be examined in detail during the clause-by-clause review of the bill. Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar told rep\u00adorters after the meeting that all parliamentary parties were participating in the process and that the government had also \u201crequested the opposition to contribute constructively\u201d.

The incident has raised serious concerns about the collapse of the state\u2019s home administration under the Congress government. Retired senior police officer SK Umesh, who served for over 35 years in the Bengaluru Police Department, has expressed deep concern that such lapses are a grave threat to national security. Reacting to the viral videos showing Umesh Reddy using a mobile phone and watching television inside his cell \u2014 and another clip of a Lashkar terrorist scrolling through a smartphone \u2014 Umesh warned that this points to systemic corruption and negligence within the jail system. \u201cThese irregularities are not new, but what is worrying is that no corrective action is being taken. Allowing access to mobile phones and VIP luxuries inside prison walls is dangerous for the country\u2019s security,\u201d he told TV9 Kannada. Umesh further added that jails must serve the purpose of correction and discipline, not luxury and comfort. Also Read: Karnataka: HC dismisses state govt\u2019s appeal against stay on public event permissions; Hearing posted for Nov 13 He has suggested the appointment of an IPS officer as the superintendent of Parappana Agrahara Jail, emphasising that only strong leadership can ensure discipline and accountability. \u201cAt present, the Additional Deputy Commissioner is handling the prison administration, but an IPS-level officer can bring efficiency and control,\u201d he remarked. Despite the Supreme Court\u2019s recent warning in the Darshan case over VIP treatment of prisoners, such incidents continue unabated in Karnataka\u2019s jails. Umesh condemned instances where inmates are allowed to celebrate birthdays with cakes and special meals, calling it a violation of jail rules. \u201cPrison is a place for reform, not recreation,\u201d he said, demanding strict action to restore order. Royal hospitality for terrorist inside prison In a shocking revelation, ISIS recruiter Juhad Hamid Shakeel Manna, one of the most wanted terrorists, has also been reportedly enjoying royal treatment inside Parappana Agrahara. Sources reveal he has been using a smartphone inside the jail without restriction, communicating with outsiders and behaving \u201clike a king.\u201d Terrorist or VIP?

The exposure of his VIP treatment has triggered public anger, with many questioning whether Parappana Agrahara Jail has turned into a safe haven for terrorists and hardened criminals. Videos showing both Umesh Reddy and the Lashkar terrorist using phones have gone viral, prompting citizens to demand accountability from the Siddaramaiah-led government. Opposition lashes out at Congress Leader of the Opposition R. Ashoka launched a scathing attack on the state government, accusing it of turning Parappana Agrahara into a \u201cparadise for terrorists.\u201d Speaking to the media, Ashoka said, \u201cWhen notorious criminals and terrorists are enjoying VIP treatment inside jail, what is the Home Department doing?

However, the Ministry of Finance has asked the Ministry of Industries and Production to first seek the IMF\u2019s clearance for the incentives proposed under the new policy.Officials said a meeting between IMF representatives and a team led by Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Industries and Production Haroon Akhtar Khan is expected later this month to discuss the annual fiscal cost of the incentives planned for various sectors.The policy targets $60 billion in exports by 2030, GDP growth of 6pc and manufacturing growth of 8pc annually by the end of the decade. It aims to provide a roadmap for industrial competitiveness, job creation and export expansion.Key constraintsThe NIP identifies a range of structural and policy-related challenges impeding industrial growth. These include macroeconomic instability, policy uncertainty, costly industrial land, excessive regulation, unreliable and expensive power supply, and limited access to long-term credit.NIP targets $60bn exports by 2030; identifies high costs, weak regulation and uneven taxation as key hurdlesThe ministry said local industries face high borrowing costs and limited access to capital markets. Weak investor protection and an inadequate insolvency framework have further discouraged lending, leaving banks with few tools to restructure loans.The policy notes that uneven taxation across sectors discourages industrial investment. While manufacturing bears a heavier tax burden, sectors such as real estate, construction, wholesale and retail remain undertaxed, reducing returns on industrial ventures.Manufacturing firms also face foreign exchange constraints, with frequent delays in accessing dollars for importing raw materials. In some cases, foreign investors struggle to repatriate profits, deterring foreign direct investment.The NIP highlights weak standards compliance, which hampers exports, and calls for reforms to improve product quality and certification systems. It also stresses the need for inclusive industrialisation, noting that women remain largely excluded from industrial entrepreneurship and management. \u201cWomen remain at the periphery and suffer from a sense of not belonging. This needs to change, and more women industrialists must be promoted,\u201d the document states.The policy proposes a predictable and transparent taxation regime consistent with IMF-backed reforms. It recommends widening the tax net and ensuring that all sectors contribute proportionately to their share of value-added in GDP.The NIP also calls for the review and simplification of corporate income tax (CIT), currently set at 29pc, higher than the regional average of 26pc, which affects export competitiveness. The super tax, levied in addition to the CIT, should also be reassessed to ease the burden on industries, the document says.Structural measuresTo support struggling firms, the policy proposes setting up a National Industrial Revival Commission (NIRC) to oversee company rehabilitation and coordinate regulatory support.It further calls for strengthening intellectual property rights (IPR) through accession to the Patent Cooperation Treaty and enhancing the enforcement capacity of the Intellectual Property Organisation of Pakistan (IPO) to counter counterfeiting and piracy.Reducing port charges, particularly those levied by the Karachi Port Trust (KPT) and Port Qasim Authority (PQA) \u2014 among the highest in the world \u2014 is also recommended to improve export competitiveness.Officials said the policy, once approved, will serve as a framework for industrial transformation through improved governance, fiscal discipline and an enabling environment for private investment. However, its implementation will depend on IMF endorsement of the incentive package, given Pakistan\u2019s commitments under the ongoing economic stabilisation programme.Published in Dawn, November 9th, 2025", "country": ["pakistan"], "category": ["top", "business"], "pubDate": "2025-11-09 02:26:56", "source_id": "dawn", "source_name": "Dawn"}, "10ad0866a12adfd7aa6c3277adf69b5b": {"link": "https://sny.tv/articles/jets-garrett-wilson-expected-to-return-vs-browns", "title": "Jets' Garrett Wilson expected to return vs. Browns after two-game absence", "description": "It looks like the Jets are about to get their WR1 back for Sunday's matchup with the Cleveland Browns.", "country": ["united states of america"], "category": ["sports"], "pubDate": "2025-11-09 02:26:52", "source_id": "yahoo", "source_name": "Yahoo!

Amendment to Article 175, he said, was \u201cvirtually the end of the judiciary as we knew it\u201d, arguing that the Supreme Court had been \u201camended out of the Constitution by making it irrelevant\u201d.Former additional attorney general Tariq Mehmood Khokhar said the essence of the package was twofold.First, the insertion of a new Chapter 1A in the Constitution that, in his view, tightens executive control over the superior judiciary through expanded powers to transfer high court judges, and establishes an FCC \u201cempowered by disempowering the Supreme Court\u201d.Second, an amendment to Article 243 that formally vests the office of Chief of the Defence Forces in the Chief of the Army Staff and constitutionally guarantees the Field Marshal rank for life. Another lawyer, also speaking on condition of anonymity, said that although the senior-most of the two chiefs would chair the Judicial Commission of Pakis\u00adtan, \u201cfor all other purposes, the FCC will be in the commanding position\u201d.He pointed out that wherever the oaths of judges of the Supreme Court and FCC are mentioned, the FCC is referenced first. \u201cIt is clear now which court is higher in terms of hierarchy,\u201d he said.He noted that under the amended Article 175A, the chief justice of the FCC is listed before the chief justice of the Supreme Court and will have a longer tenure, retiring at 68, compared to the current retirement age of 65 for Supreme Court judges.\u2018Forward-looking reform model\u2019In contrast, senior counsel Hafiz Ahsaan Ahmad Khokhar welcomed the initiative, calling the proposed 27th Amendment \u201ca major and long-awaited structural shift\u201d in the justice system.He said the creation of two separate apex courts \u2014 the existing Supreme Cou\u00adrt dealing primarily with appellate functions, and a new FCC with exclusive jurisdiction over constitutional interpretation, inter-governmental disputes and matters arising under Article 199 \u2014 ref\u00adlected \u201ca forward-looking reform model\u201d.This division, he argued, would bring Pakistan closer to systems in many established democracies where constitutional and advisory jurisdictions are institutionally distinct, providing \u201cgreater clarity, efficiency and constitutional coherence\u201d.He said the reforms could help depoliticise the higher judiciary, eliminate internal divisions, reduce backlogs and prevent overlapping between constitutional and appellate benches.Mr Khokhar said the amendments to Article 243 were in line with \u201cmodern constitutional democracies\u201d, with a unified advisory framework under a principal military adviser answerable to the prime minister, the defence minister and the National Security Committee.Meanwhile, newly elected Supreme Court Bar Association President Haroonur Rasheed supported the idea of setting up an FCC, and said the association was considering convening an All Pakistan Lawyers Convention, in consultation with the Pakistan Bar Council and other bar bodies. \u201cI am glad that an FCC is being established in the country by amending the Constitution with consensus and unanimity,\u201d he said.Published in Dawn, November 9th, 2025", "country": ["pakistan"], "category": ["top", "politics"], "pubDate": "2025-11-09 02:24:50", "source_id": "dawn", "source_name": "Dawn"}, "8e7f0746963e544302a60dd0147494ec": {"link": "https://www.etvbharat.com/en/international/syrian-president-ahmed-al-sharaa-arrives-in-us-for-landmark-visit-enn25110900562", "title": "Syrian President Ahmed Al-Sharaa Arrives In US For Landmark Visit", "description": "Sharaa's Washington trip comes after his landmark visit to the United Nations in September, the first Syrian president in decades to address the UNGA.", "country": ["india"], "category": ["lifestyle"], "pubDate": "2025-11-09 02:24:48", "source_id": "etvbharat", "source_name": "Etv Bharat"}, "980fa4d913ecca00de045963a73b0b6d": {"link": "https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/congress-bjp-leaders-jostle-for-space-credit", "title": "Congress, BJP leaders jostle for space, credit", "description": "The Vande Bharat train launch in Punjab sparked political clashes between BJP and Congress.

Even at the end after we conceded the goal we had a massive chance to win it.\"At the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, Bryan Mbeumo fired Manchester United ahead in the 32nd minute amid mounting discontent among home fans.Booed off at half-time, Tottenham hit back and looked to have secured a dramatic victory after Mathys Tel equalised in the 84th minute and Richarlison deflected in a shot from Wilson Odobert in the 91st minute.But United defender Matthijs de Ligt powered in a 96th-minute header to extend his side's unbeaten run to five games.Tottenham's failure to hold onto the lead was another blow to their dismal record in home league games in 2025, which includes only one win in six top-flight matches in North London this term.Neither manager was satisfied with the outcome and United boss Ruben Amorim said: \"We have so much to grow as a team because today was our day to win. If we have a little bit more bravery, we can kill this game.\"Tottenham manager Thomas Frank added: \"A lot of things we could have done a bit better. The last goal is all about the urgency, maybe don't give the cross away and defend better.\"At Stamford Bridge, Chelsea quelled criticism of Enzo Maresca's rotation policy.Maresca made eight changes against Wolves following their Champions League draw against Azerbaijani minnows Qarabag on Wednesday.French defender Gusto, who arrived from Lyon in 2023, put Chelsea ahead after the interval with his maiden professional goal.Joao Pedro doubled the lead and Pedro Neto wrapped up Chelsea's fourth win in their last five league games.

Request everyone to pray for his speedy recovery and respect the family\u2019s right to privacy\u201d.Earlier, on Monday evening, Dharmendra\u2019s sons, actors Sunny Deol and Bobby Deol visited him. Another Bollywood superstar Salman Khan was also seen arriving at the hospital with heavy security.Bollywood megastar Shah Rukh Khan was also seen arriving at the Breach Candy Hospital in South Mumbai to meet the veteran actor after the latter was admitted.The actor\u2019s Rolls-Royce Cullinan Black Badge was seen arriving at the hospital. The actor\u2019s elder son Aryan Khan was also seen with him paying a visit to the veteran actor.Dharmendra, who was reportedly put on a ventilator, is said to be suffering from breathing difficulties. Dharmendra is one of Bollywood\u2019s most enduring and beloved stars. He was born in 1935 in Punjab, and began his career in the early 1960s, after he was discovered through a talent hunt competition. In the late 1950s, Filmfare magazine, in collaboration with Bimal Roy Productions, organized a nationwide talent contest to find new faces for Hindi cinema.Dharmendra entered the competition and was selected as the winner in 1958, chosen for his striking looks and natural charm. This victory opened the door to the film industry for him. The same talent hunt would later go on to discover Rajesh Khanna, one of Hindi cinema\u2019s biggest superstars.He quickly rose to fame with his charming looks, emotional depth, and effortless screen presence. His versatility allowed him to excel in romance, action, and comedy alike. Some of his most iconic films include \u2018Phool Aur Patthar\u2019, which established him as a leading man, and \u2018Sholay\u2019, where his portrayal of the lovable, witty Veeru became legendary.While \u2018Chupke Chupke\u2019 displayed his impeccable comic timing, action-packed dramas like \u2018Yaadon Ki Baaraat\u2019 solidified his image as the quintessential Bollywood hero. Beyond his cinematic career, Dharmendra\u2019s humility and charisma have made him a cherished figure both on and off screen.(IANS)", "country": ["india"], "category": ["entertainment", "top"], "pubDate": "2025-11-11 03:16:57", "source_id": "sambadenglish", "source_name": "Sambad English"}, "d118806de3360650a689de27e7803fc2": {"link": "https://thenationonlineng.net/thieves-as-victims-of-tankers-explosions/", "title": "Thieves as victims of tankers explosions", "description": "Life has today become very cheap in Nigeria.

[YONHAP] When working for a single company, one doesn't expect to constantly be signing employment contracts. That, however, was the reality for one 30-year-old worker \u2014 four contracts in 18 months. Financial difficulties meant the worker was desperate for a renewal each time. The looming end of each contract, every three to six months, was the most nerve-wracking aspect of the job. Related Article93% of surveyed Coupang workers object to KCTU proposal restricting late-night deliveriesCoupang hit with most FTC fines over past 3 years at $114 millionFTC uncovers unfair terms in Coupang Eats and Baemin delivery platforms When asked by a more senior colleague to cover peak shifts on Friday evenings or Saturday afternoons, the worker found it difficult to say no, despite feeling the requests were unfair. The employee often worked an extra hour or two after clocking out during busy periods \u2014 without receiving additional pay. \u201cEvery time it was the month to sign a new contract, I had nightmares that I wouldn\u2019t be rehired and would have to scramble to find a new job,\u201d the worker said. \u201cIt felt like my blood was drying up.\u201d Cases like this have put a spotlight on the widespread practice of repeatedly signing ultra-short-term contracts \u2014 dubbed \u201cchopped-up\u201d contracts \u2014 especially for nonregular workers. The issue gained national attention after a 20-something worker surnamed Jeong, who had been employed at popular bakery chain London Bagel Museum, was suspected to have died from overwork. Critics have pointed to the chain\u2019s reliance on short-term contracts as a contributing factor. Jeong\u2019s family said the employee signed contracts for three, four and seven months, rotating between three store locations over 14 months. London Bagel Museum said the contract terms were based on salary increases linked to promotions and the transfers between stores. Workers load cargo at a Coupang logistics center in Songpa District, southern Seoul. [YONHAP] Not illegal, but \u2018a legal loophole\u2019 Social democratic Justice Party leader Kwon Young-guk issued a statement criticizing the practice. \u201cChopped-up contracts may not be illegal, but they\u2019re a legal loophole that contributes to chronic job insecurity, fostering environments ripe for long working hours and exploitation,\u201d Kwon said. \u201cCoupang\u2019s logistics centers also use a similar model \u2014 contracts split into three-, nine- or 12-month terms \u2014 which creates a constant fear of job loss,\u201d said Kwon. \u201cWorkers say they feel like disposable parts.\u201d For workers repeatedly subjected to short-term contracts, job insecurity isn\u2019t the only concern. They are also more exposed to power abuse and workplace bullying. \u201cIt\u2019s common for workers to endure mistreatment in hopes of renewing their contracts,\u201d said Kim Ki-hong, a labor attorney at labor law firm Dolbloom. \u201cMany tolerate verbal abuse from superiors or work unpaid overtime.\u201d From an employer\u2019s perspective, however, short-term contracts are attractive because they offer greater flexibility. The shorter the term, the easier it is to avoid labor obligations tied to longer employment. Under the Labor Standards Act, workers employed for fewer than three months are not entitled to a 30-day dismissal notice or equivalent pay, meaning employers can terminate them freely. From one year of employment, employers must pay severance and annual leave; after two years, under the Act on the Protection of Fixed-term and Part-time Employees, workers must be converted to permanent status unless the contract is for temporary work. Social democratic Justice Party members hold placards during a press conference outside the Seoul regional office for employment and labor in Jung District, central Seoul, on Nov. 6, calling for measures to prevent another death like the one at London Bagel Museum. [YONHAP] Even public institutions use 'chopped-up' contracts The practice isn\u2019t limited to private companies. Public institutions have also come under scrutiny for using short-term contracts. During a city audit in Gwangju on Thursday, city council member Chae Eun-ji revealed that 171 public sector employees in Gwangju were hired on nine-month contracts and 132 on 11-month contracts. \u201cA nine-month term is a tactic to hire irregular workers for permanent jobs, and 11 months is just a way to dodge obligations toward severance pay,\u201d Chae said. \u201cIt\u2019s disheartening to see this kind of contract trickery in taxpayer-funded public institutions.\u201d The rate at which public corporations converted fixed-term workers to permanent positions dropped from 21.7 percent in 2009 to 14.3 percent in 2021, according to a report by the Korea Labor Institute. Civic groups and lawmakers are increasingly calling for reform. The Justice Party held a press conference on Thursday proposing a new law to prevent ultra-short-term contracts, as well as revisions to the Labor Standards Act to require permanent employment for regular, ongoing tasks. The proposed act would enshrine the right of workers to request contract renewal and prohibit employers from terminating contracts arbitrarily. \u201cWhat\u2019s needed in reality is stronger administrative oversight,\u201d said labor attorney Ok Dong-jin. \u201cThe Labor Ministry needs to supervise and determine whether a job truly requires short-term hiring or if it should be a regular position.\u201d This article was originally written in Korean and translated by a bilingual reporter with the help of generative AI tools.

Some officials have suggested that countries focus on smaller efforts that do not need universal consensus, after years of COP summits making lofty promises only to leave many unfulfilled.Brazil\u2019s President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva warned against interests trying to obscure the dangers of climate change in his opening remarks.\u201cThey attack the institutions, the science, the universities,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s time to imp\u00adose another defeat to denialists.\u201d The world\u2019s biggest historical emitter of greenhouse gases, the United States, opted to skip the summit at the federal level, while US President Donald Trump asserts that climate change is a hoax.However, a state-level US presence was expected, with California Gov Gavin Newsom and New Mexico Gov Michelle Lujan Grisham scheduled to arrive in Belem on Tuesday.Addressing a global investors summit, Newsom questioned the federal government\u2019s disengagement. \u201cWhat the hell is going on here?\u201d Newsom said about the US government\u2019s absence from the talks.\u201cWe\u2019re in Brazil, one of our great trading partners, one of the world\u2019s great democracies. I mean hell, home to all the rare earth metals we need. This is the country we should be engaging with instead of giving the middle finger with 50 percent tariffs,\u201d Newsom said.European nations planned to use the summit to press for firm commitments. Germany said it would join other European countries to push for commitments to rein in fossil fuel use, a goal also promoted by Lula.Warning signsDelegates were joined by Indigenous leaders, who arri\u00adv\u00aded on Sunday by boat after travelling some 3,000 kilometres (1,864 miles) from the Andes.They are demanding more say in how their territories are managed as climate change escalates and industries such as mining, logging and oil drilling push deeper into forests.\u201cWe want to make sure that they don\u2019t keep promising, that they will start protecting, because we as Indigenous people are the ones who suffer from these impacts of climate change,\u201d said Pablo Inuma Flores, an Indigenous leader from Peru.\u2014ReutersPublished in Dawn, November 11th, 2025", "country": ["pakistan"], "category": ["environment", "top"], "pubDate": "2025-11-11 03:11:51", "source_id": "dawn", "source_name": "Dawn"}, "4453bed6587fe57bf4ccee6f0cb4dab6": {"link": "https://arynews.tv/jeff-goldblum-embraces-positive-change-after-taking-on-wicked-role/", "title": "Jeff Goldblum embraces positive change after taking on \u2018Wicked\u2019 role", "description": "Jeff Goldblum has opened up about the positive changes he\u2019s experienced since taking on the role of the Wizard in the film adaptation of Wicked.

Wall Street analysts are calling the pivot a watershed moment for the Pentagon's procurement system, signaling the most significant overhaul of U.S. defense acquisition strategy in decades.According to a memo obtained by Bloomberg News, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is preparing to launch a new \"economic defense unit\" to issue updated contracting guidelines and a \"playbook of modern commercial contract and agreement structures.\"\"These large defense primes need to change to focus on speed and volume, and invest their own capital to get there,\" Hegseth said in a recent speech, adding, \"If they do not, those big ones will fade away.\"Here's a roundup of the latest commentary from Wall Street analysts (courtesy of Bloomberg) offering their take on the Pentagon's sweeping procurement pivot:Bernstein (Douglas S. Harned):Called the speech \"the most aggressive yet\" on defense-acquisition reform, warning that large, established primes may face challenges after years of tailoring their operations to legacy processes. Harned expects newer, commercially oriented defense firms to be near-term winners, given the department's bias toward off-the-shelf, agile solutions.Melius Research (Scott Mikus):Said Hegseth's memo and remarks should serve as a wake-up call for both primes and suppliers. The planned drive to heighten competition threatens to erode the value of proprietary intellectual property that major contractors have long relied on for pricing power.Truist Securities (Michael Ciarmoli):Observed that this time \"feels different,\" citing urgency to field next-generation technology and avoid lagging adversaries. Legacy contractors are \"in the crosshairs,\" while nimble entrants \"sit in the catbird seat.\" The effort will dismantle rigid Pentagon bureaucracy and force the industry to overhaul its own business models.TD Cowen (Roman Schweizer):Noted that Hegseth criticized big primes for cost overruns, schedule slips, and bloated backlogs, urging them to assume more risk and boost internal R&D and capital spending. He concluded that the remarks signal \"significant and sweeping changes\" to weapons development, procurement, and the broader defense-industrial landscape.All the talk about modernizing the Pentagon\u2019s procurement system is very encouraging, but it won\u2019t mean much without a major reshoring or friendshoring of supply chains for critical semiconductors and rare earth minerals, the lifeblood of next-generation drones, fifth-generation attack aircraft, night vision, and the list goes on and on. Without securing these inputs, America\u2019s odds of achieving true battlefield dominance in the 2030s remain up in the air. Time to put reshoring into hyperdrive.

Nvidia earnings, Fed cuts", "description": "JPMorgan stays bullish, sees U.S. government reopening and NVDA earnings as key near-term catalystsJPMorgan strategists reiterated their tactical bullish stance on equities, calling the recent pullback a buying opportunity ahead of several potential tailwinds, including the likely reopening of the U.S. government.In a note to clients, the bank said a resolution to the shutdown would \u201cbuttress current-quarter GDP forecasts\u201d and could release additional liquidity into markets, typically a supportive factor for stocks. Stronger near-term liquidity and improving growth momentum underpinned their constructive view.Another focus is Nvidia\u2019s upcoming earnings, which JPMorgan expects could reassure investors about the durability of the AI-driven growth theme and help sustain this quarter\u2019s revenue and EPS outperformance across the tech sector.The strategists also see the Federal Reserve delivering another 25bp rate cut in December, barring a surprise surge in hiring, while elevated corporate buyback activity should continue to bolster market support.However, JPMorgan cautioned that risks to its view include a miss on Nvidia\u2019s results, an extended government shutdown, weaker-than-expected buyback execution, or a renewed spike in bond volatility and yields. Even so, the bank said overall positioning remains light and retail investor participation subdued \u2014 conditions that could amplify the upside if sentiment turns.

"\u2022 CJCSC urged troop mobilisation\u2022 COAS cautioned against hasty escalationISLAMABAD: The Natio\u00adnal Secur\u00adity Committee (NSC) did not overrule the then army chief Gen Qamar Bajwa\u2019s response plan during the 2019 Balakot crisis, according to at least two participants of that meeting who spoke on Monday.\u201cThe then army chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa\u2019s response strategy was agreed upon and executed by the Pakistan Air Force,\u201d said a federal minister who attended the meeting, adding that the then chairman of the joint chiefs of staff committee, Gen Zubair Hayat, had proposed a more radical option that was not accepted.An armed forces official who also participated in the meeting gave a similar account, saying that then prime minister Imran Khan was \u201cdispleased\u201d with Gen Hayat\u2019s suggestion, which he thought \u201cdid not make any sense.\u201dThe statements counter a recent claim by former defence secretary Lt Gen (Retd) Asif Yasin Malik, who said that during the 2019 NSC meeting held after the Balakot strikes, Gen Bajwa had advised restraint but was overruled by the air chief and the CJCSC.The 2019 escalation followed a Feb 14 suicide bombing in Pulw\u00adama, India-occupied Kashmir, which killed 40 Indian paramilitary personnel.India responded with airstrikes on Balakot on Feb 26, the first time since the 1971 war that Indian aircraft had crossed deep into Pakistani territory.According to the two participants, who spoke separately to Dawn, the sequence of events began in the early hours of Feb 26, 2019, when then chief of general staff (CGS) Gen Nadeem Raza called Gen Bajwa at about 2:30am to report an Indian airstrike near Balakot.Gen Bajwa asked for an assessment of the damage, and the CGS later informed him that no significant damage had occurred.A seminary built during the Afghan war, used for religious education of local children, had been the intended target.However, the missile missed its mark and landed some distance away, causing no casualties or structural damage.Soon afterwards, the then air chief marshal Mujahid Anwar contacted Gen Bajwa to discuss the situation.Gen Bajwa suggested that since no damage had been caused, the matter could be addressed during a meeting with the prime minister later that morning.Before attending the NSC meeting, Gen Bajwa convened his core team at General Headquarters (GHQ), where the director general of military operations (DGMO) suggested that Pakistan must respond, but in a measured way, to avoid escalation.The DGMO proposed that, unlike India\u2019s night raid on a single site, Pakistan should strike multiple targets in broad daylight to send a clear message and restore deterrence.The response operation, later known as Operation Swift Retort, was conceived during these consultations.Gen Bajwa then took the plan to the National Security Committee meeting at the Prime Minister\u2019s House. During the session, Gen Zubair Hayat spoke for about 40 minutes, emphasising that he was the prime minister\u2019s principal adviser in times of war.When Gen Bajwa asked for his concrete suggestion, Gen Hayat proposed full mobilisation of troops and a declaration of war against India.According to participants, Gen Bajwa cautioned against hasty escalation. He then presented the operational plan prepared at GHQ, which was approved by the NSC. The detailed strategy was subsequently discussed with the PAF chief, who executed the air operation, they recalled.On Feb 27, Pakistani aircraft struck six targets in India-occupied Kashmir, hitting \u201copen spaces\u201d to demonstrate their capability to hit Indian targets without escalating the tensions further.Published in Dawn, November 11th, 2025", "country": ["pakistan"], "category": ["politics", "top"], "pubDate": "2025-11-11 03:05:01", "source_id": "dawn", "source_name": "Dawn"}, "f4d1fc64361ae34c1544ebcdfcebf1b0": {"link": "https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2025/11/11/japan/bear-aid-outdoor-bath-fences/", "title": "Japan weighs aid for outdoor bath fences amid bear attacks", "description": "The Japan Tourism Agency is aiming to cover half the cost of installing fences around outdoor baths at inns and hotels.", "country": ["japan"], "category": ["environment", "top"], "pubDate": "2025-11-11 03:05:00", "source_id": "japantimes", "source_name": "The Japan Times"}, "01989c6d8107960704c3cd0e652e031f": {"link": "https://www.japantimes.co.jp/life/2025/11/11/food-drink/art-pickling-cookbook-japan/", "title": "Brine and dine: A guide to pickling your Japanese vegetables", "description": "Yoko Nakazawa\u2019s debut cookbook offers a deep dive into preserving your greens \u2014 a method that has formed the bedrock of her family\u2019s culinary traditions.", "country": ["japan"], "category": ["top", "food"], "pubDate": "2025-11-11 03:05:00", "source_id": "japantimes", "source_name": "The Japan Times"}, "a2a88244ee12b5289b2b9df5b66f569c": {"link": "https://www.sharonherald.com/sports/rodgers-off-night-leaves-steelers-clinging-to-afc-north-lead-as-ravens-heat-up/article_f4091ff2-78e2-52a4-944a-27f8f3aaf55d.html", "title": "Rodgers' off night leaves Steelers clinging to AFC North lead as Ravens heat up", "description": "The Pittsburgh Steelers and Aaron Rodgers are reeling after a lopsided loss to the Los Angeles Chargers.

The event featured Dr Jayaprakash Narayan, retired IAS officer and chief guest, who delivered a detailed address on the RSS\u2019s century-long legacy and civilisational mission. Joining him as the main speaker was Vadla Bhagayya, RSS Akhil Bharatiya Karyakarini sadasya, who traced the organisation\u2019s early journey in the Telugu regions. Dr Jayaprakash Narayan described the 100-year history of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh as \u201cextraordinarily distinguished\u201d, stating that no other organisation in modern world history matches its character and contribution. He noted that some religious institutions rely on lifelong celibate preceptors, and some revolutionary outfits emerged briefly in emotional moments to fight for the country. But, he said, no organisation in 150 years has quietly inspired thousands to dedicate their lives for a long-term civilisational goal without seeking recognition, except the RSS. He praised the Sangh for sacrifice without desire for fame, emphasising that its philosophy mirrors the idea that great work is possible only when people fight for the goal itself, not for glory. Read More: \u2018RSS at 100 \u2013 New Horizons\u2019: Guests hail the role of Sangh in nation-building, cherish their enduring association Dr Narayan said the RSS internalises the values of non-violence, truth, non-stealing, non-possessiveness and celibacy, adding that the nation remains indebted to the Sangh for its constant efforts to reform society from within. He stressed that despite India\u2019s rich heritage, society remains fragmented, and the Sangh works tirelessly to build unity. He clarified that the RSS has never demanded adherence to any single Hindu tradition, reiterating the inclusive principle of \u201cEkam Sat Viprah Bahudha Vadanti.\u201d Dr Narayan said Sangh ideology places society above the State, and its long-term mission seeks to restore self-confidence, self-respect and a sense of dignity within communities. Calling the unification of India\u2019s diverse groups an \u201cextraordinary yajna\u201d, he expressed admiration for the Sangh\u2019s sustained work over a century. Historical recollections by senior Sangh leader Vadla Bhagayya Akhil Bharatiya Karyakarini Member Vadla Bhagayya, the main speaker, traced the historical evolution of the RSS in Telugu states. He said figures like Bandaru Sadashiva Rao, Subrahmanya Shastri and Rambhau Haldekar began documenting the Sangh\u2019s early growth, and their compiled material has now taken shape as a book. Due to Nizam rule, Hindu mobilisation was difficult in Telangana, so Sangh activities began first in Vijayawada and Nuzvid towns of Andhra Pradesh. Bhagayya narrated the episodes of Nuzvid Raja\u2019s daughter visiting a Sangh utsav in Pune, becoming impressed, and facilitating the sending of Koonakulli Subrahmanyam and Raghavachari to Nagpur for training \u2014 leading to the first Shakhas in Nuzvid. He recalled how Yadwalker ji, Bandishta ji, and local leaders like Raghavarao and even a young N.T. Rama Rao, came into contact with Sangh work during these early years. After Telangana\u2019s liberation, Sangh work expanded from 1950 onwards, starting with a Shakha under Venkateshwar. Key pracharaks included Shankar Rao (Warangal), Komaravolu Narayana Rao, Sriram Sateji, and later K.V. Satyanarayana and Haldekar ji. Historic milestones included 2,000 people attending Yadav Rao Joshi\u2019s meeting in Warangal, and 114 swayamsevaks marching from Parakala to Warangal during Guruji\u2019s visit, with families offering food in every home. Bhagayya highlighted the contributions of Shathagopachari, who personally treated Deendayal ji, Moghe ji and Guruji, and became a pillar of Sangh work in Warangal. He emphasised that Sangh work in Telangana grew because many householders and employees resigned their jobs to serve full-time. Pulusu Gopireddy, Krishnamurthy, Raju and Komarigiri Rammohan were among those who travelled across regions to strengthen the movement. Shakhas gradually spread across 30 villages of Parakala, strengthened by Paakam Rajaveerayya and MP Jagga Reddy, with even Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Kabaddi tournaments being held to mobilise youth. The attendees included people from all walks of life across the twin cities, particularly senior swayamsevaks and Sangh functionaries from the state and shared their association with RSS and recollected the memories.", "country": ["india"], "category": ["politics", "top"], "pubDate": "2025-11-11 03:00:44", "source_id": "organiser", "source_name": "Organiser Weekly"}, "4b87f1266a793168d3e751a692b24d9d": {"link": "https://www.thehansindia.com/news/cities/khammam/durishetty-drives-reading-revolution-at-govt-schools-through-storytelling-1022269", "title": "Durishetty drives reading revolution at govt schools through storytelling", "description": "\u2018Every Child Reads\u2019 initiative to boost reading skills at Khammam govt schools", "country": ["india"], "category": ["education", "top"], "pubDate": "2025-11-11 03:00:44", "source_id": "thehansindia", "source_name": "The Hans India"}, "735c9ea310459174ab882858e4b84957": {"link": "https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-microsoft-finally-makes-good-on-its-syncable-passkey-promise-and-whats-coming-next/", "title": "How Microsoft finally makes good on its syncable passkey promise - and what's coming next", "description": "The phased rollout of Microsoft's platform authenticator strategy began last week for Edge on Windows 10 and 11.

This strengthens Yubico's commitment to helping organizations, governments, and individuals verify identities amidst increasing deepfakes, fraud, and AI deception.\u201dAvailability for YubiKey as a Service was expanded to all countries in the European Union earlier this year.Yubico added multi-protocol keys to its line of biometric hardware tokens through a partnership with Hypr last year.Swissbit is pleased, if not exactly impressed. The company\u2019s iShield Key 2 is a hardware security key developed in collaboration with RSA that brings biometric binding to passkeys.\u201cIt is encouraging to see the industry embracing identity verification in passkey workflows,\u201d says Atreedev Banerjee, global business director at Swissbit. \u201cWe previewed these capabilities months ago and showcased them at Authenticate 2025 \u2013 demonstrating face biometric verification with liveness detection, hardware-rooted identity proofing that is convenient, privacy-preserving, and secure, and unified physical and logical access control with continuous authentication option. It appears the market is finally catching up.\u201d", "country": ["canada"], "category": ["technology", "top"], "pubDate": "2025-11-11 21:34:40", "source_id": "biometricupdate", "source_name": "Biometric Update"}, "6416fe3b276db6213a1bc1c6222faad5": {"link": "https://www.soompi.com/article/1797103wpp/november-drama-brand-reputation-rankings-announced-2", "title": "November Drama Brand Reputation Rankings Announced", "description": "The Korean Business Research Institute has revealed this month\u2019s brand reputation rankings for dramas!

She denies any wrongdoing, and so far, all evidence to come out in public has contradicted the charges against her.However, the original source of the allegations came from Pulte, sometimes referred to as Trump's \"attack dog,\" as he unearthed the mortgage documents that kicked off the controversy. He has made similar allegations against Sen. Adam Schiff (D-CA) and Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, neither of whom currently face criminal charges.All of this comes shortly after the FHFA cleaned house, dismissing a number of high-ranking officials overseeing ethics, including Fannie Mae chief ethics officer Suzanne Libby, general counsel Danielle McCoy, and FHFA acting inspector general Joe Allen. Pulte has claimed these firings were because the people in question were involved in diversity, equity, and inclusion, or DEI, projects, which have been a frequent bogeyman for the Trump administration.An FHFA spokesperson told the Journal, \u201cThe anonymous sources in this story are attempting to obstruct the criminal justice system by completely fabricating false and defamatory claims,\u201d but did not elaborate on what claims were false and defamatory.", "country": ["united states of america"], "category": ["politics", "top"], "pubDate": "2025-11-11 21:33:52", "source_id": "rawstory", "source_name": "Raw Story"}, "3c6bb28b9b96d1ca8355d0ed39d412b2": {"link": "https://411mania.com/wrestling/wwe-raw-netflix-viewers/", "title": "WWE RAW (November 3) Draws 2.4 Million Netflix Viewers, Ranks Ninth Globally", "description": "The November 3, 2025, episode of WWE RAW recorded 2.4 million viewers on Netflix, placing ninth on the platform\u2019s global Top 10 television rankings for the week.The post WWE RAW (November 3) Draws 2.4 Million Netflix Viewers, Ranks Ninth Globally appeared first on 411MANIA | Wrestling News, WWE & AEW Results.", "country": ["united states of america"], "category": ["sports"], "pubDate": "2025-11-11 21:33:49", "source_id": "411mania", "source_name": "411mania"}, "04f84fcbbe72194ebdfda74cc249598b": {"link": "https://www.phillyvoice.com/body-found-trash-can-schuylkill-river-trail-norristown/", "title": "Norristown police find body in trash can along Schuylkill River Trail", "description": "Norristown police found the body of a man inside a trash can along the Schuylkill River Trail.

Unfortunately, the agenda reflected AMD\u2019s new corporate priorities: with the bulk of AMD\u2019s revenue now coming from its datacenter business, AMD scheduled just twenty minutes for its client businesses. AMD chief executive Lisa Su also identified the datacenter as \u201cthe most strategic business\u201d for AMD.Before it did, however, AMD also revealed some brief details of its architectural roadmaps., where AMD chief technology officer Mark Papermaster announced that AMD was working on Zen 7, its next-generation CPU architecture. That will underpin AMD\u2019s Ryzen CPUs, where in the desktop Su said that AMD commands over 50 percent of the desktop CPU channel.\u201cWe\u2019ve delivered five generations of the Zen CPU,\u201d Papermaster said. \u201cWe split it into high performance versions, power and compact, cloud optimized version also used in our networks, but all maintaining a consistency of instruction set architecture. We went where no company was willing to go in the bet we made with chiplets.\u201dMark Hachman / FoundryAMD\u2019s Zen 5 architecture is the foundation of the Ryzen 9000 family. The Zen 6 architecture will debut in the company\u2019s next-gen EPYC processor for servers, debuting this year, Papermaster said.Papermaster didn\u2019t say anything about Zen 7, though he showed it on a roadmap slide. (That slide didn\u2019t include an estimated ship date, either.) AMD continues to stagger its design teams, assigning one team to each architecture generation and going back and forth. (That means that the Zen 5 team is now shifting to work on Zen 7.) AMD also continues to develop two types of cores for each Zen architecture, one focusing on performance and the other focusing on power.Mark Hachman / FoundryPapermaster also provided an early look at AMD\u2019s desktop graphics roadmap, though without revealing many details. AMD is equally interested in improving the performance of its desktop GPUs as well as other edge applications where it can apply GPU compute.Papermaster also showed off some of the improvements AMD is considering for its NPU roadmap as well. There, AMD plans more AI TOPS and more power efficiency, without going into details.Mark Hachman / FoundryJack Huynh, the senior vice president who heads the Computing and Graphics Group at AMD, did not go into additional details, though he did indicate that AMD plans to move into edge AI as well as its existing markets in the mobile, workstation, and desktop markets.AMD has a \u201cno compromise\u201d PC strategy he said, infusing AI into everything the company does.\u201cWe\u2019ve built tremendous momentum, and we have a clear path to market leadership,\u201d Huynh said. \u201cNow we\u2019re entering a new era. AI is transforming the PC experience and redefining what compute means across every device in our portfolio. This is not just another product cycle, it\u2019s a once in a generation shift towards expanding our opportunity across every segment. Our next chapter is about scaling the client business, deepening our council advantage, and unlocking new growth with AI at the edge. If I can leave you one thought today, it\u2019s we are ready to lead the gaming and AI PC era.\u201d", "country": ["united states of america"], "category": ["technology", "top"], "pubDate": "2025-11-11 21:30:58", "source_id": "pcworld_us", "source_name": "Pcworld"}, "64d738bcc4945841d4b7734cb44e06c5": {"link": "https://www.caughtoffside.com/2025/11/11/west-ham-contact-tottenham-manor-solomon/", "title": "Report: London rivals now in contact Tottenham over January move for 26-year-old ace", "description": "West Ham United are hoping to sign the Tottenham attacker Manor Solomon during the January transfer window.

A press release cites popular demand for the 16 new dates, which include Sunday, May 3, 2026 at ACL Live.That means fans can see Williams May 2 or 3 at the same venue. It is the only stop in Texas; of all the new dates added, only two expanded the tour \u2014 called Good Dye Young Presents: Hayley Williams At A Bachelorette Party \u2014 to additional cities.The tour starts in Atlanta, Georgia, on March 27 and ends in Dublin, Ireland, on June 30. For every stop, Williams will perform Ego Death in full. Water From Your Eyes will open for both Austin dates.This is Williams' first-ever solo tour, following a long career as the frontwoman and singer of Paramore. She was among the founding members of the band in 2004, when she was just 15 years old. The group has performed together for more than 20 years (including two energetic showings at Austin City Limits Music Festival in 2022) and this fall, Williams confirmed that they are taking a break \u2014 not broken up.Ego Death is also Williams' first release outside of the contract she signed as a teenager. It was released on her own label, Post Atlantic Records, and distributed by Secretly Distribution.As of Friday, November 7, Williams has garnered four nominations in the 68th annual Grammy Awards for Best Alternative Album, Best Alternative Music Performance (for \"Parachute\"), Best Rock Performance (for \u201cMirtazapine\u201d), and Best Rock Song (for \u201cGlum\u201d).Efforts to prioritize fans over resellers have resulted in a layered ticket sales process.First, fans who want to participate in the pre-sale need to pre-register and be verified at hayleywilliams.net.

The provision relates to funding for the Department of Agriculture, and was flagged by Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, home to a burgeoning hemp industry.Paul introduced an amendment to strip the language on Monday, but the amendment failed. Subsequently, the Senate passed the bill with the prohibitive language intact. However, the bill, which would impact everything from smokable hemp products to hemp-derived THC drinks, won\u2019t take effect until 365 days after it is signed into law. Sales of hemp and hemp-derived products were allowed under the 2018 Farm Bill, and that\u2019s led to the sale of certain cannabis-derived products around the country, sometimes in contrast to state laws. The new language would ban sales of any products containing THC, of which hemp may contain trace amounts, effectively outlawing it. On X, Paul defended his amendment, even if it slowed the reopening process, saying that protecting constituents\u2019 jobs is under his purview.\u201cJust to be clear: I am not delaying this bill,\u201d he wrote on Monday. \u201cThe timing is already fixed under Senate procedure. But there is extraneous language in this package that has nothing to do with reopening the government and would harm Kentucky\u2019s hemp farmers and small businesses. Standing up for Kentucky jobs is part of my job.\u201dNotably, Kentucky\u2019s other Senator, Mitch McConnell, was at odds with Paul over his proposed amendment. The hemp industry in Kentucky employs roughly 3,500 people, and worries about a potential ban have been floating around since earlier this year. A statement released in June by the Kentucky Hemp Association seemingly preempted this week\u2019s action in the Senate, too.\u201cKentucky has emerged as a national leader in hemp production and innovation,\u201d it reads. \u201cNow is not the time for the federal government to impose arbitrary changes that disrupt this progress. The hemp industry has consistently called for thoughtful regulation that protects consumers while preserving economic opportunities for farmers,\u201d it continues. \u201cRather than rolling back years of responsible development, federal policy should reinforce this thriving sector\u2014not seek to recriminalize it.\u201d", "country": ["united states of america"], "category": ["top"], "pubDate": "2025-11-11 21:30:00", "source_id": "fastcompany", "source_name": "Fast Company"}, "f181e1537b30ed30c32e1d1de7a066d9": {"link": "https://www.eonline.com/news/1424892/banana-republic-office-styles-up-to-50-off", "title": "Banana Republic Has Chic Office Staples up to 50% off Today", "description": "If you've ever found yourself standing in front of your closet in the morning and nothing is really calling out to you, you're not alone.

These questions are front of mind this year after a lack of cool-season rainfall, together with warmer than average temperatures.To assist with developing a water plan, Agriculture Victoria is running a series of relaxed and informal, morning tea webinars. There will be plenty of time to ask questions and share knowledge and experience.Participants also will have access to a range of past webinar recordings, videos and resources as part of the webinar series.Presented by Mr Sturmfels who has more than 45 years experience in the design, construction and repair of farm dams and farm water reticulation systems, the series is full of practical information and tips for farmers to help set themselves up now and into the future.The webinars will be held at 10am every Tuesday from November 18 to December 16.

After clashes with law enforcement that briefly saw the arrest and release of Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, Trump-installed New Jersey U.S. Attorney Alina Habba indicted Rep. LaMonica McIver for forcibly impeding federal officers.But the motive behind the indictment was immediately thrown into question by partisan statements put out by the Department of Homeland Security social media account, which, among other things, posted on X that \"Delaney Hall Detention Center houses the WORST OF THE WORST! This stunt by sanctuary lawmakers puts the safety of our law enforcement agents and detainees at risk.\" McIver's defense team has cited the posts as evidence of an unlawful prosecution.In the latest filing as part of the case against McIver, attorneys for the government have stated these posts have been taken down.This comes as the Trump administration has come under fire for a number of prosecutions of President Donald Trump's political critics and opponents, including former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James, that appear to be politically motivated and pushed from the top by the president.It also comes as Habba, who served as a defense lawyer in some of Trump's own legal issues before he was re-elected, has faced court decisions determining she was not legitimately appointed to the role of U.S. attorney in the first place.", "country": ["united states of america"], "category": ["politics", "top"], "pubDate": "2025-11-11 21:24:02", "source_id": "rawstory", "source_name": "Raw Story"}, "a758fbf2fc9fa1dbdacb7b65be3f5e3d": {"link": "https://www.chicagotribune.com/2025/11/11/raja-krishnamoorthi-oak-park-democrats/", "title": "Senate candidate Raja Krishnamoorthi makes his pitch to Oak Park Democrats", "description": "U.S. Rep.

Real self-love at these times is less about bubble baths and makeovers more about making decisions that protect one\u2019s wellbeing. Setting emotional, physical and financial boundaries becomes a deeply meaningful act of self-respect and healing. Redefining Self-Love in Times of Change Self-love, at its heart, is about choosing to honour one\u2019s needs and values, especially during emotionally charged periods such as separation. Self-love involves setting boundaries around time and energy, prioritising personal goals and caring for oneself as you would a friend. During a transition, one might redefine self-love by saying \u201cno\u201d to what drains me, and \u201cyes\u201d to what strengthens me. That might mean stepping back from hurtful conversations, choosing restful routines over expectations, and creating safe spaces for healing. The Role of Boundaries in Emotional Recovery Boundaries are the building blocks of healing. By clarifying what one will and will not accept a person rebuilds confidence, reduces conflict and creates space for recovery. Emotional boundaries might mean: \u201cI will not engage in calls that leave me anxious,\u201d or \u201cI will ask for time alone before I respond.\u201d Setting ...", "country": ["united kingdom"], "category": ["lifestyle"], "pubDate": "2025-11-11 21:21:26", "source_id": "newsanyway", "source_name": "News Anyway"}, "1c1cca50665d7a1da8fcf160c0a43d3a": {"link": "https://www.orovillemr.com/2025/11/11/san-jose-sharks-minnesota-wild-william-eklund-macklin-celebrini/", "title": "Sharks-Wild preview: San Jose makes lineup changes; how to watch Tuesday\u2019s game", "description": "San Jose Sharks will have William Eklund for Tuesday's game against the Minnesota Wild at Grand Casino Arena", "country": ["united states of america"], "category": ["entertainment", "sports"], "pubDate": "2025-11-11 21:21:23", "source_id": "orovillemr", "source_name": "Orovillemr"}, "e6c5365d3c034221d36ac2753155d8b1": {"link": "https://www.ghanamma.com/2025/11/11/first-11-farmer-service-centres-to-begin-operations-next-year/", "title": "First 11 Farmer Service centres to begin operations next year", "description": "President John Dramani Mahama has confirmed that the government will launch the first 11 farmer service centres next year, a move aimed at boosting agricultural productivity and supporting year-round farming.

The US and Israeli officials working on the plan termed them as \"Alternate Safe Communities\". Palestinians would be screened for \u201canti-Hamas\u201d sentiment before being granted entry into the compounds. The proposal was discussed in an email by US Lieutenant General Patrick Frank, who is heading the civil-military coordination centre overseeing the Gaza ceasefire, which has been marred by regular Israeli violations.In an email reported by The Atlantic, Frank said that each settlement should include a medical centre, a school, an administrative building, and temporary housing for about 25,000 people. But the Atlantic reported that the plan is constantly shifting, and the number of occupants slated to live in the developments changes \"almost by the day\". \"A team of US, UK, and Israeli military officials working on the project has already revised the intended occupancy of each community down to about 6,000, from an original estimate of 25,000,\" the Atlantic reported. President Donald Trump\u2019s son-in-law and advisor, Jared Kushner, publicly floated the idea of the US and its partners reconstructing parts of Gaza occupied by Israeli troops, while leaving the war-ravaged enclave\u2019s core, which is governed by Hamas, destroyed.No timeline for Israeli withdrawalThe idea of dividing Gaza has plenty of pitfalls, but in recent weeks, two Arab diplomats familiar with the US peace plan said they were taking the US push seriously.The Financial Times reported that the proposed plans have alarmed Arab states and European countries as potentially being the first step in a permanent occupation of a portion of Gaza. Egypt and Turkey wary of 'disarmament' language in Gaza UN resolution, sources says Read More \u00bbAccording to the Atlantic, less than two percent of Gaza\u2019s two million-strong population lives behind the so-called yellow line. This barrier is supposed to be temporary.Trump\u2019s 20-point peace plan envisions Israel eventually withdrawing all of its troops from Gaza with the exception of a small security perimeter. Israeli troops are supposed to move out as an Arab peacekeeping force enters. Eventually, that force is envisioned to hand security over to a \u201creformed\u201d Palestinian Authority.The US plan provides no timeline for Israel\u2019s withdrawal.At its core, the plan would require Palestinians in central Gaza to willingly accept living under territory controlled by Israeli troops.The plan also needs money. The Trump administration has not pledged any US sovereign funds for Gaza\u2019s reconstruction. Trump says he wants Gulf states to invest.The Atlantic reported that a senior administration official said at least one pilot city would be built in southern Gaza near Rafah, which is home to the enclave\u2019s border with Egypt.Land ownershipOf course, one of many elephants in the room is Palestinian ownership of the land on which the sites will be built. The Gaza Strip has a formal land registry. The registry was run by Hamas but followed the basic institutional framework of the Palestinian Authority\u2019s system.Israel has reduced most of Gaza to rubble. The United Nations estimates that the enclave\u2019s reconstruction will cost roughly $70bn. In the West Bank, which Israel has occupied since 1967, the government and settlers have seized swaths of Palestinian land and evicted thousands of Palestinian families from their homes. The Atlantic said that Israel\u2019s Shin Bet would scan applicants to live in the housing complexes. One criterion would not only be whether an individual had ties to Hamas, but their wider family\u2019s ties to the group.Hamas has governed Gaza since 2007. After winning Palestinian legislative elections, it clashed with secular rival Fatah, which exercises limited control of the occupied West Bank through the Palestinian Authority.According to The Atlantic, a US-based engineering and consulting firm that works with the US military, Tetra Tech Solutions, has already been awarded a State Department contract to clear unexploded ordinance and rubble from the site of the first Alternate Safe Community.

Instead, Democrats are bearing the brunt of the political losses in the immediate term, while Republicans are bracing for longer-term consequences,\" according to the report. GOP strategists are cautioning Republican lawmakers to be careful about cutting costs and specifically removing Affordable Care Act subsidies, which are popular among Americans. \"A KFF poll released last week found 74 percent of Americans supported extending tax credits, and among those who do, 3 in 4 say either Trump or congressional Republicans would deserve most of the blame if Congress does not extend them,\" The Post reports.Republicans will now have to \"work on a soft landing for health care,\" according to Patrick Sebastian, a GOP strategist in North Carolina. Sebastian argues Democrats \"got nothing\" from the shutdown and also noted that cutting off ACA subsidies could be a difficult challenge for Republicans. \u201cOnce you give someone something and you take it away a hundred percent, it\u2019s politically difficult,\u201d Sebastian said.Some White House insiders have told The Post they don't think President Donald Trump will have long-term challenges and view the shutdown as only temporary, while his approval ratings drop and Republicans saw major defeats in elections last week. So far, the administration has made no mention of the ACA or health care, instead pivoting to affordability. \"They\u2019ve suggested that recent dips in the president\u2019s approval rating are merely blips and emphasized a focus on driving prices down for consumers, which has emerged as a political liability,\" according to The Post.", "country": ["united states of america"], "category": ["politics", "top"], "pubDate": "2025-11-11 21:16:03", "source_id": "rawstory", "source_name": "Raw Story"}, "a546e7d1211167298ca262af13dfbc1f": {"link": "https://www.dailystar.co.uk/sport/football/liverpool-heros-jaw-dropping-daughter-36230731", "title": "Liverpool hero's jaw-dropping daughter inundated with offers after dad's message", "description": "Liverpool hero Neil Mellor, who put himself in Anfield folklore with a strike against Arsenal, was once inundated with offers to marry his daughter", "country": ["united kingdom"], "category": ["sports"], "pubDate": "2025-11-11 21:16:03", "source_id": "dailystar", "source_name": "Dailystar Co Uk"}, "9b41fb9268aea26e632e068843d9d24f": {"link": "https://www.sun-sentinel.com/2025/11/11/dolphins-deep-dive-does-mcdaniel-deserve-more-blame-for-this-season-video/", "title": "Dolphins Deep Dive: Does McDaniel deserve more blame for this season? | VIDEO", "description": "In this Dolphins Deep Dive video, the South Florida Sun Sentinel\u2019s Chris Perkins and Dave Hyde discuss if former general manager Chris Grier was a scapegoat and if coach Mike McDaniel deserves more blame for Miami\u2019s struggles this season. \u00a92025 South Florida Sun-Sentinel.

When money is tight, payday and title loans may seem like a lifeline, but some borrowers tell NBC 5 Responds they ended up deeper in debt.Read on for questions consumers can consider. Plus, where to find options for fast cash.\u2018NEVER ACTUALLY GETTING TO THE PRINCIPAL\u2019NBC 5 Responds recently reviewed a North Texas consumer\u2019s auto title loan agreement. The consumer borrowed $2,000 and shared receipts that showed nearly $7,000 in payments over 16 months. In that time, the consumer was no closer to paying off the original loan.\u201cWith these loans, you\u2019re never actually getting to the principal,\u201d said Samantha Kehl with Legal Aid of NorthWest Texas. Kehl, an attorney, heads the bankruptcy practice team at LANWT. Kehl said she\u2019s seen consumers fall into a debt trap after turning to payday and title loans.Some include a balloon payment, requiring the full principal plus fees at the end of the term. If a consumer can\u2019t afford it, they can refinance the loan, which adds more fees.\u201cYou\u2019re just paying these fees. To ever get out of it, you\u2019ve got to come up with the full balance plus a little bit of interest in one month, and they just don\u2019t have the funds to do it,\u201d Kehl said.The nonprofit Texas Appleseed said average fees can equal interest rates around 200-500% APR. NBC 5 Responds also searched online for fast loan options. We saw fee schedules over 700% APR for Texans.COST TO BORROW\u201cYou see the advertisements of people with big wads of cash, and you think these are lenders, but in fact, they\u2019re not lenders. They\u2019re actually loan arrangers. Under Texas law, they\u2019re called a credit access business, and their fees are not capped under our state interest rate caps,\u201d said Ann Baddour, director of the Fair Financial Services project at Texas Appleseed.Texas Appleseed tracked numbers showing 27% of title loan borrowers had cars repossessed last year, with consumers often losing transportation to school or work.\u201cPeople have emergencies, people need access to credit in a pinch, but we should make sure that what\u2019s available in the market is not something that\u2019s going to sink them even further,\u201d Baddour said. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to tie an anchor to a person who\u2019s drowning.\u201dWhen a consumer signs up, disclosures are required on loan agreements, showing the cost of borrowing.\u201cI feel like disclosures are great, but we can\u2019t control when people get them or how they\u2019re explained, how things are sold to people,\u201d Baddour said. \u201cAnd we can\u2019t control for desperation, which is why we need to have fair practices to begin with in the market.\u201dSome local cities have ordinances regulating the lending practices of credit access businesses. NBC 5 Investigates reported that some groups are pushing for stricter state-level rules, saying cities may lack resources to enforce an ordinance, and lenders can operate in a neighboring city to avoid local regulations.SqueezedNov 5Data suggests more and more DFW families are falling behind on their billsNBC 5 RespondsNov 6Free and low-cost help for debt and creditWe asked a trade group representing some short-term lenders about fee caps.The Online Lenders Alliance pointed to its 2025 policy priorities. It said government-imposed price caps would limit consumer access to credit and leave consumers with fewer options \u2013 including those with thin or poor credit.On its website, another trade group, Community Financial Services Association of America, said restrictions could cause consumers to see overdraft charges at their bank, seek out unregulated lenders or file for bankruptcy.In an email to NBC 5, INFiN said, in part, \u201cConsumers benefit from more credit options, not fewer, in today\u2019s rapidly changing, competitive consumer financial services marketplace, so that they can choose the form of credit that best meets their financial situation. INFiN and its members remain committed to promoting credit access, financial inclusion, responsible lending, and consumer education across the communities we serve.\u201dIt also said, \u201cOur members in Texas and across the country work closely with customers to ensure loans meet, not exceed, their financial needs, using underwriting processes that consider dozens of factors including income, repayment ability, and compliance with all applicable laws.\u201dEMERGENCY LOAN OPTIONSTexas Appleseed said consumers can look for a nonprofit lender offering small loans, like Capital Good Fund. Its website said it works with applicants with less-than-perfect credit. Consumers can check their eligibility, loan ranges and APR here. The nonprofit said it also offers financial coaching programs. The FTC said consumers can search for \u201cpayday alternative loans\u201d or PAL loans, typically offered by a credit union.Resource One Credit Union said it offers quick cash loans to its members, listing a starting APR of 25%. Each credit union has its own membership criteria. Eligibility may depend on things like where you live or your employer. Some credit unions allow any consumer to become a member by donating a small fee to a partner foundation or association.You can also ask your bank about small-dollar, short-term loans.When you\u2019re considering any loan, understand the cost to borrow, including service fees and interest. How much of the payments go towards the principal? In this article, NerdWallet said find a lender that assesses your ability to repay. If they don\u2019t, they may count on a consumer taking out more loans to repay the first.A non-profit credit counselor can also help you manage debt. If you\u2019re looking for emergency loans, a credit counselor may look at your budget and help you come up with a plan. The National Foundation for Credit Counseling has a contact form on its website to connect consumers to nonprofit counselors. Or call its agency finder at 800-388-2227.

And it went over so well with players that it's staying in the game for good.Image via Activision\"Thanks to your beta feedback, the majority of Black Ops 7's multiplayer playlists will have Open matchmaking, which will be similar to the beta experience where skill is minimally considered,\" Treyarch announced today. However, SBMM isn't going away for good. Treyarch said that there will be a \"Closed Matchmaking\" rotating moshpit playlist at launch \"where skill will be an important consideration, and Ranked Play will also use skill as an important consideration when it launches\" early in 2026.In addition to this great news, BO7 will also have persistent lobbies instead of breaking up every lobby after each game as CoD has done over the past few releases. Both of these concerns have been big complaints among the playerbase since 2019, so to see the changes finally being made, it has gone over very well with CoD gamers.With the reduced SBMM in the beta, BO7 felt like a different game compared to most recent releases, in the best way. The lobbies felt more like a crap shoot as to what kind of players you match with and against, as opposed to actively being punished for performing well. And even better, the connections felt great and matchmaking queues would pop very quickly. For now, I have to admit that I'm slightly concerned that the announcement is worded carefully to say that the SBMM \"will be similar to the beta experience,\" and not just a one-to-one. But I'm optimistic.If BO7's multiplayer can feel like this for good, then we may be in for one of the better CoD titles in recent years from a multiplayer standpoint. Coupled with campaign, Zombies, and the new Endgame co-op mode, it could be a good year for CoD fans.The post Black Ops 7 doubles down on removing SBMM, with one minor exception appeared first on Destructoid.", "country": ["united states of america"], "category": ["entertainment"], "pubDate": "2025-11-11 21:15:03", "source_id": "destructoid", "source_name": "Destructoid"}, "d92e717e6de6d13ad90239e0edac718d": {"link": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/nigeria-cartel-lagos-port-cocaine-b2863283.html", "title": "Nigeria, US and UK to investigate cartel behind $235 million cocaine seizure at Lagos port", "description": "The significant seizure represents one of the largest in the country's history", "country": ["united kingdom"], "category": ["top", "crime"], "pubDate": "2025-11-11 21:15:03", "source_id": "independentuk", "source_name": "The Independent"}, "ab6ad171836e424dfcd08ba3031205ed": {"link": "https://www.nbcsports.com/watch/golf/golf-today/rory-mcilroy-feels-responsibility-to-help-dp-world-tour", "title": "Rory McIlroy feels 'responsibility' to help DP World Tour", "description": "Rory McIlroy discusses the new award in his name and his emotions toward the DP World Tour before Damon Hack and Eamon Lynch react to the Grand Slam winner's comments.", "country": ["united states of america"], "category": ["sports"], "pubDate": "2025-11-11 21:15:01", "source_id": "nbcsports", "source_name": "Nbc Sports"}, "c673832a31a00e209baa6912b381e335": {"link": "https://www.ekathimerini.com/in-depth/society-in-depth/1286354/how-a-surgeons-promise-helped-his-patient-walk-and-run-again/", "title": "How a surgeon\u2019s promise helped his patient walk \u2013 and run \u2013 again", "description": "A year after a car accident nearly claimed his life, 36-year-old British electrician Adam Shaw crossed the finish line of the Athens Marathon alongside the surgeon who saved him.", "country": ["greece"], "category": ["top", "crime"], "pubDate": "2025-11-11 21:15:00", "source_id": "ekathimerini", "source_name": "Ekathimerini.com"}, "545930d5c151239830ce3dc0dc334da7": {"link": "https://www.benzinga.com/pressreleases/25/11/n48791798/lucid-group-inc-announces-proposed-convertible-senior-notes-offering", "title": "Lucid Group, Inc.

The Kentucky modern firearm deer season brings outdoorsmen and outdoorswomen from far and wide to our great state known for hospitality and phenomenal deer-hunting opportunities. So, back to the simple question: Where have all the deer gone?Here is my honest and professional opinion on that question \u2013 it\u2019s complicated \u2013 but I will try to shed some light on the subject.First and foremost, EHD (Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease), commonly known to most as blue tongue, took a devastating toll on deer populations in certain counties. Within any individual county, we saw huge variances in occurrence and mortality from the disease, which is spread by a midge fly. If your area saw significant mortality rates from EHD, it likely took out a disproportionate number of 21\u20442- and 31\u20442-year-old bucks compared to does, leaving your area with a gap within the buck age class. This will alter deer rut and movement behavior. With fewer mature bucks in the age class and higher-than-normal doe-to-buck ratios, territorial displays are minimized, leaving fewer scrapes, rubs and what we all hunt for \u2014 the chase.Many are asking about CWD, or Chronic Wasting Disease. Has this affected Kentucky\u2019s population? My answer to that is no \u2014 not yet. Although CWD has been detected within the wild cervid population in more than one county in the state and close to our borders within surrounding states, the prevalence of the disease is not high enough at this point to make any difference. Please note the key words \u201cnot yet\u201d and \u201cat this point.\u201d Make no mistake \u2013 this 100 percent fatal disease can and will alter our deer herd of the future. That\u2019s why we must all do our part to follow Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife rules and recommendations as they pertain to minimizing unnecessary risk of disease transportation. If we all use common sense and do our best to fight the spread, we will all be better for it \u2013 especially our children and grandchildren, who we hope will spend their hard-earned money and even harder-earned time in the woods for some much-deserved peace and quiet.Now let\u2019s talk about date and weather. This is the earliest modern firearm season can open \u2013 always the second Saturday in November \u2013 and this year that date was early, on the 8th. Most hunters are in the woods at least a week earlier than in past years. Our weather has been at least two weeks behind the entire year. My son Tucker showed me a picture from his deer stand on Nov. 3, 2023, versus Nov. 3, 2025. In 2023, it looked like the dead of winter with not a single leaf on a tree; this year, many of the trees, especially white oaks, were still fully leaved and green. Acorn drop from white oaks was overall late this year \u2013 typically dropping heavy by the first week of October \u2013 but white oaks are still dropping acorns today. The moon has been bright at night, the wind has blown seemingly every day, and the temperature has swung from highs to lows. All these factors keep deer in their beds during daylight hours and allow them to move at night when winds are calm, temps are cooler and no one is bothering them.Anyone can go online and research harvest data for individual or all counties within the state. Looking at my home county of Crittenden, September and October numbers are within the average harvest, but November is definitely behind. Many will say, \u201cHow can you say November is down in harvest? It\u2019s only the 11th.\u201d Only one-third of the month has passed and only one-fourth of the modern firearm season, but history shows that opening weekend always produces the highest overall harvest days. In November we typically see a harvest of 2,000 to 2,500 deer, with a ratio basically at 50/50 buck to doe harvest, which is great. As of today, the total harvest is 753, and that is low.Looking at the brighter side, I believe the best hunting opportunity is yet to come. If your area has seen significant deer mortality due to EHD, the future may be bright for producing record-book potential in the near future. Now, you probably think I\u2019ve lost my mind, but think about this: We all know all Zone 1 counties in the state have too many deer per square mile \u2013 however you want to quantify it. Simply put, we have too many deer, and that\u2019s bad for overall herd health, including antler development and spread of disease such as EHD. As the herd rebounds, you will have a two- to three-year window of opportunity for antler development before overall numbers again reach unhealthy levels. Opportunity exists after EHD to continue harvesting does and keep the population balanced in sex ratios and within the surrounding ecosystem.We, as stewards of the land, should take note of the changes we\u2019ve all seen and do our part to make the future as bright as possible. We can accomplish this by doing more than simply planting a food plot or putting out a deer feeder.

He named the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act as a distinct highlight, calling it \u201cthe most consequential piece of legislation in modern history.\u201d\u201cIt was my highest privilege to author and lead President Trump\u2019s \u2018One Big Beautiful Bill,\u2019 the principle legislative vehicle for advancing the America First Agenda, which included the largest tax and spending cuts, largest single investment in national and border security, and most significant welfare reforms in U.S. history,\u201d Arrington said in a statement. \u201cLet me be clear, I haven\u2019t lost an ounce of passion for promoting West Texas values in Washington or a shred of fight for defending our freedoms and way of life, but I believe it\u2019s time for this chapter in my journey to come to an end.\u201dHe did not announce his next steps, saying that he planned to spend more time with his family and will \u201clook forward to my next leadership challenge.\u201d Arrington has said he wants to pass another Republican spending bill \u2014 the GOP still has a year of a guaranteed trifecta before the midterms.The Lubbock Republican\u2019s retirement ends a lengthy political career. Arrington worked in George W. Bush\u2019s gubernatorial administration and then as a senior advisor in the Bush White House. He went on to be chief of staff for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and worked on the federal effort to rebuild the Gulf Coast after Hurricane Katrina.Arrington then returned to Lubbock to work under then-Texas Tech Chancellor Kent Hance, who had previously represented Arrington\u2019s same West Texas district in Congress. Arrington began serving as the Texas Tech University System\u2019s chief of staff in 2006, then was tapped to be vice chancellor for research and commercialization in 2011. After a stint leading a health care innovation company and an unsuccessful Texas Senate bid, Arrington entered Congress in 2017.Arrington quickly rose through the ranks of the Budget Committee and became its chair when Republicans took the majority after the 2022 midterm election. Long focused on efforts to reduce the national debt, he has advocated for various plans to significantly cut spending and balance the budget \u2014 a stance that has at times led to conflict with fellow Republicans. Arrington will leave behind both the powerful Budget Committee chairmanship and a safely deep-red GOP seat, creating an opportunity for a Republican successor to begin a lengthy congressional career. Situated in rural West Texas and including Abilene and Lubbock, the 19th Congressional District, which was left untouched by Republican map-drawers in the Legislature\u2019s recent redistricting, voted for Trump by a 52-point margin in 2024, his best performance in all 38 Texas congressional districts. But prospective Republican successors will need to make quick decisions \u2014 the filing deadline is Dec. 8. Democrat Kyle Rable first announced his campaign in May.Between the new congressional map passed by the Texas Legislature to create more Republican-friendly seats and the retirements of Republican Reps. Michael McCaul and Chip Roy, the 2026 midterm is poised to usher in an entire class of Republican freshmen in Texas\u2019 Washington delegation. One of three Texans to hold committee chairmanships, Arrington\u2019s name was floated for speaker during the 2023 House GOP race for the gavel. His decision to retire is another blow to Texas\u2019 power in the House \u2014 already a far cry from the last Republican trifecta from 2017 to 2019, when seven Texans held chairmanships. Only 10 of Texas\u2019 38 representatives have more seniority than Arrington. Of those, three are facing difficult reelection prospects due to redistricting and two are retiring.Disclosure: Texas Tech University System has been a financial supporter of The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization that is funded in part by donations from members, foundations and corporate sponsors.

Because it\u2019s already the fourth day\u201d of the search mission, Zamri told journalists.\u201cHe was excited to see us ... Physically, he looked exhausted.\u201dIman was stranded near a waterfall, meaning he had a source of fresh water, the rescuer said.Missing boatOfficials say the migrants on the capsized boat were members of the Rohingya community trying to reach Malaysia.They were likely part of a larger group of some 300 people who had left Myanmar two weeks ago and were split between at least two boats.Police reported the second vessel as missing and its fate was unknown.As search operations continued, Malaysian authorities said another eight bodies had been recovered by Tuesday afternoon, taking the total to 20.On the Thai side, an official told AFP on condition of anonymity that six bodies had been found, including at least two who carried identification cards issued by the United Nations\u2019 refugee agency UNHCR.Fourteen survivors, mainly Rohingya and Bangladeshi citizens, have been rescued in Malaysian waters since rescue operations started on Sunday.At least 12 vessels were searching for survivors in an area of around 250 square nautical miles, roughly the same size as Singapore.\u2018Urgent concerns\u2019Relatively affluent Malaysia is home to millions of migrants from poorer parts of Asia, many of them undocumented, working in industries including construction and agriculture.Sea crossings, facilitated by human-trafficking syndicates, are hazardous and often lead to overloaded boats capsizing.The Rohingya have been persecuted in Myanmar for decades, and thousands risk their lives every year to flee repression and civil war, often aboard makeshift boats.In 2024, some 657 Rohingya died in the region\u2019s waters, according to UNHCR figures.Medical charity Doctors Without Borders (MSF) said that the latest shipwreck \u201craises urgent humanitarian concerns\u201d.\u201cNo one leaves Myanmar or Bangladesh by choice \u2013 these are dangerous boat journeys undertaken by people out of fear for their lives,\u201d MSF said in a statement.-Agence France-Presse", "country": ["new zealand"], "category": ["top", "crime"], "pubDate": "2025-11-12 00:24:34", "source_id": "newstalkzb", "source_name": "Newstalkzb"}, "7d942a2109e4e07d8f120151c81606e4": {"link": "https://www.wthr.com/article/news/local/indiana-university-lecturer-pulled-teaching-class-student-complaint-lesson-discussing-white-supremacy/531-fe8fefc2-771c-4a45-815e-9f4738bd2559", "title": "IU lecturer pulled from teaching class after student complaint on lesson discussing white supremacy", "description": "IU School of Social Work lecturer Jessica Adams said a student in her class for master's students made the complaint to the office of Republican Sen.

This collaboration elevates UnionPay's acceptance rate to nearly 100% for POS terminals and 90% for ATMs across Kazakhstan, with breakthroughs achieved among small and medium-sized merchants in border areas and small-to-medium towns. It marks a qualitative leap in UnionPay's local acceptance network and provides solid support for China-Kazakhstan cross-border payments and people-to-people exchanges.The partnership spans high-frequency consumption scenarios across Kazakhstan, including premium and everyday supermarkets, gas stations, beauty stores, and fast-food restaurants. It significantly enhances the payment experience for UnionPay cardholders locally. This development aligns well with the growing personnel exchanges since the China-Kazakhstan mutual visa exemption agreement to effect: in the first half of 2025, Chinese tourists' arrivals in Almaty reached 54,100, a year-on-year increase of 33.4%. UnionPay's expanding network now delivers more efficient, convenient payment support for cross-border travel and business.This collaboration represents a key milestone in UnionPay's nearly two-decade dedication to Kazakhstan. UnionPay cardholders can flexibly use diverse payment methods such as swiping, tapping, and mobile Pay at popular attractions like Shymbulak Ski Resort and Kok Tobe, as well as in mobility scenarios including Yandex Go rides, urban public transport, and Air Astana services.To date, millions of UnionPay cards have been issued in Kazakhstan, with their transaction volumes in China surging nearly threefold year-on-year in H1 2025. The partnership with Kaspi not only solidifies the foundation of UnionPay's local payment network but also reinforces its role as a key financial link between China and Kazakhstan, facilitating the connection of financial infrastructure and people-to-people exchange between the two countries.Hashtag: #UnionPayThe issuer is solely responsible for the content of this announcement.", "country": ["philippines"], "category": ["top"], "pubDate": "2025-11-12 00:24:20", "source_id": "manilatimes", "source_name": "The Manila Times"}, "e73de90206bb0e3e1e247c7a776f58e3": {"link": "https://www.summitdaily.com/news/photos-frisco-elementary-school-celebrates-veterans-day-with-special-commemoration-assembly/", "title": "PHOTOS: Frisco Elementary School celebrates Veterans Day with special commemoration assembly", "description": "Frisco Elementary School celebrates Veterans Day with special commemoration assembly Every year, Frisco Elementary School takes a moment to honor the veterans living in the Summit County community by hosting a commemoration ceremony.

[NEWS1] Former Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn was arrested at his home on Wednesday by the special counsel team investigating insurrection and foreign aggression allegations tied to the Dec. 3 martial law crisis last year. A search warrant for his home was also executed upon his arrest. Special Prosecutor Cho Eun-seok\u2019s team obtained the arrest warrant after Hwang repeatedly refused to cooperate with the investigation, according to legal sources. Related ArticleEx-spy chief arrested over alleged martial law involvementConcerns grow over new investigation into officials who aided martial lawGov't to launch task force to identify officials involved with martial law attemptEx-spy chief attends arrest hearing over alleged martial law involvementSpecial counsel again seeks arrest warrant for ex-justice minister in martial law probe The team previously attempted to execute search and seizure warrants at Hwang\u2019s residence on Oct. 27 and 31, but failed on both occasions, as Hwang refused to open the door and was shielded by crowds of supporters. In a briefing on Nov. 3, the special counsel said it had obtained a new search warrant but had not yet executed it. The investigation centers on a Facebook post Hwang made on Dec. 3 last year in which he appeared to endorse the declaration of martial law by then-President Yoon Suk Yeol. Hwang is under investigation for inciting and propagating insurrection. In the post, Hwang wrote, \u201cMartial law has been declared. Preventing national chaos is the top priority,\u201d and called for a crackdown on \u201cpro-North leftist forces and election fraud forces that have ruined the country.\u201d He also demanded the arrest of National Assembly Speaker Woo Won-shik and then-People Power Party leader Han Dong-hoon, claiming they were obstructing the president\u2019s emergency actions. Under the Special Counsel Act on Insurrection, the special counsel is authorized to investigate criminal allegations related to the Dec. 3 martial law incident, including recommending the declaration of martial law, securing detention facilities, murder committed for insurrection-related purposes, conspiracy or preparation for insurrection, and incitement or propaganda related to insurrection.

The PBOC follows a managed floating exchange rate system that allows the value of the yuan to fluctuate within a certain range, called a \"band,\" around a central reference rate, or \"midpoint.\" It's currently at +/- 2%. How the process works:Daily midpoint setting: Each morning, the PBOC sets a midpoint for the yuan against a basket of currencies, primarily the US dollar. The central bank takes into account factors such as market supply and demand, economic indicators, and international currency market fluctuations. The midpoint serves as a reference point for that day's trading.The trading band: The PBOC allows the yuan to move within a specified range around the midpoint. The trading band is set at +/- 2%, meaning the yuan could appreciate or depreciate by a maximum of 2% from the midpoint during a single trading day. This range is subject to change by the PBOC based on economic conditions and policy objectives.Intervention: If the yuan's value approaches the limit of the trading band or experiences excessive volatility, the PBOC may intervene in the foreign exchange market by buying or selling the yuan to stabilize its value. This helps maintain a controlled and gradual adjustment of the currency's value.---Earlier:Goldman delays China \u2018dual cut\u2019 to 2026, expects gradual yuan appreciation This article was written by Eamonn Sheridan at investinglive.com.", "country": ["united states of america"], "category": ["business", "top"], "pubDate": "2025-11-12 00:18:33", "source_id": "forexlive", "source_name": "Forexlive"}, "992c8707454f8eb5bf515622d8db0273": {"link": "https://www.marinij.com/2025/11/11/marin-transit-releases-electric-bus-yard-study/", "title": "Marin Transit releases electric bus yard study", "description": "The draft environmental report favors the agency's effort to construct a hub on Francisco Boulevard East.", "country": ["united states of america"], "category": ["business", "top"], "pubDate": "2025-11-12 00:18:29", "source_id": "marinij", "source_name": "Marin Independent Journal"}, "4f84b63e9c68459805ebf05f506aa6a0": {"link": "https://www.elciudadano.com/en/concerns-grow-over-result-transmission-system-in-honduras-after-mock-drill-failures-just-20-days-before-presidential-election/11/11/", "title": "Concerns Grow Over Result Transmission System in Honduras After Mock Drill Failures Just 20 Days Before Presidential Election", "description": "El CiudadanoOriginal article: Honduras: Preocupacio\u0301n por sistema de transmisio\u0301n de resultados tras fallas en simulacro a solo 20 di\u0301as de la eleccio\u0301n presidencial With only twenty days remaining until the presidential election in Honduras scheduled for November 30, there is rising concern in the country due to failures noted during a mock drill of the preliminary [...]La entrada Concerns Grow Over Result Transmission System in Honduras After Mock Drill Failures Just 20 Days Before Presidential Election se publico\u0301 primero en El Ciudadano.", "country": ["chile"], "category": ["health"], "pubDate": "2025-11-12 00:18:29", "source_id": "elciudadano", "source_name": "El Ciudadano"}, "aa322d9c1a0595b8749217c9e70abf2d": {"link": "https://www.ghanamma.com/2025/11/12/ugs-david-nakousi-retains-accra-marathon-title-as-kenyan-wachira-wins-womens-race/", "title": "UG\u2019s David Nakousi retains Accra Marathon title as Kenyan Wachira wins women\u2019s race", "description": "The 23-year-old athlete pocketed a GH\u00a210,000 cash prize after edging out Ismael Arthur David Nakousi of the University of Ghana defended his title in the elite men\u2019s category of the First National Bank (FNB) Accra Marathon on Saturday November 8, 2025, finishing the 21.1km race in 1:09:01s.

Dallas to the Los Angeles Lakers, was fired Tuesday as general manager and president of basketball operations for the Mavericks.Mavericks owner Patrick Dumont announced the move with the team off to a 3-8 start and fans chanting \"Fire Nico\" at every home game.Slovenian superstar Doncic, a Dallas fan favorite, has helped revive the Lakers, joining Wilt Chamberlain as the only NBA players to score at least 40 points in the first three games of a season.The Mavs, meanwhile, have struggled with Kyrie Irving sidelined by a knee injury despite obtaining Anthony Davis in the trade and boasting 2025 NBA Draft top pick Cooper Flagg.\"This decision reflects our continued commitment to building a championship-caliber organisation, one that delivers for our players, our partners, and most importantly, our fans,\" Dumont said.The Mavericks appointed vice president of player personnel Michael Finley and assistant general manager Matt Riccardi as co-interim general managers to oversee basketball operations.Under Harrison's guidance since taking over in June 2021, the Mavericks lost to Boston in the 2024 NBA Finals and dropped the 2022 Western Conference finals to Golden State.Dumont released a letter to fans explaining his decision and seeking their continued support.\"No one associated with the Mavericks organisation is happy with the start of what we all believed would be a promising season,\" he wrote. \"You have high expectations for the Mavericks, and I share them with you. When the results don't meet expectations, it's my responsibility to act.Dumont said he knows the team's players are \"deeply committed to a winning culture. This decision was critical to moving our franchise forward in a positive direction.\"Dumont thanked fans for their patience and support and, without mentioning the Doncic trade, added: \"I understand the profound impact these difficult last several months have had.

Massie Still Investigating Jan. 6 Provocateur Ray Epps Authored by Ken Silva via HeadlineUSA,Remember Ray Epps, the J6er who encouraged others to go into the Capitol and committed violence against police officers, only to receive a year of probation for his crimes?Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., hasn\u2019t forgotten. Massie announced on Friday that he wrote a letter to the FBI about Epps last month, seeking answers about its investigation into him.Massie asked why the FBI initially closed its investigation into Epps by July 2021, despite having an abundance of evidence about him.I sent a letter to the FBI director one month ago requesting unreleased information on Ray Epps. pic.twitter.com/I3amze9lUZ\u2014 Thomas Massie (@RepThomasMassie) November 9, 2025According to FBI records, agents had \u201cphotographic/and or video evidence that James Ray Epps conspired to and/or recruited others to storm the United States Capitol Building.\u201dHowever, a July 29, 2021, FBI report said that its \u201cinvestigation did not reveal sufficient evidence that Epps ... engaged in acts of violence or committed any other criminal violations.\u201d That\u2019s despite the fact that video had already surfaced showing him pushing a sign into a group of police officers, and that Epps had admitted to trespassing on Capitol grounds.The Justice Department apparently reopened the Epps case after Massie, Revolver News and other conservatives began to question whether he was being protected by government. The DOJ eventually slapped him with a lone misdemeanor count of disorderly conduct, and he received one year of probation in January 2024.\u201cThis disparate treatment is particularly troubling when contrasted with the cases of most January 6 defendants,\u201d Massie said in his recent letter to FBI Director Kashyap Patel. \u201cMoreover, it raises the broader question of whether other defendants were similarly spared prosecution under comparable circumstances.\u201dMassie seeks all internal communications between FBI Headquarters and its Phoenix field office, which initially investigated Epps. He also seeks all communications between the FBI and DOJ about him.Additionally, Massie wants to know whether the DOJ or any of its components, including the FBI, had any communication with Epps prior to the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol Hill protest. Such communications might indicate whether Epps was working for the government at the time.Massie sought answers by Oct. 10. It\u2019s unclear whether the FBI ever responded to the congressman\u2019s letter, which is dated Oct. 3.Ken Silva is the editor of Headline USA. Follow him at x.com/jd_cashless.

The news won\u2019t be the needle that pops the AI bubble, but it did cause enough of a stir to make Nvidia\u2019s shares drop 2% Tuesday morning. The bad vibes were muted somewhat by news of what SoftBank says it will do with the proceeds of the sell-off, along with those from the sale of some of its $9.17 billion T-Mobile stake: The firm will double down on another big bet in the AI space\u2014OpenAI.SoftBank expects to invest $30 billion directly in OpenAI this year, according to its second-quarter financial statement in September. And it had already committed $19 billion to the $500 billion Project Stargate infrastructure initiative (with OpenAI and Oracle). To bankroll these commitments, Masayoshi Son, SoftBank\u2019s CEO, likely needed to free up funds. Hence the Nvidia sell-off.For years, Son has talked about SoftBank\u2019s strategy to invest in the \u201ccomputing platforms of the future,\u201d including artificial intelligence. His firm amassed a reported $4 billion stake in Nvidia back in 2017, only to dump the shares in 2019. At the time Son had called Nvidia the \u201cthe core company of the AI revolution.\u201d He now believes that OpenAI will be that core company.During SoftBank\u2019s annual general meeting in June, Son declared he is \u201call in\u201d on OpenAI. He\u2019d always wanted to be an early major investor in the AI super-startup, he said, but Microsoft beat him to the punch. OpenAI, he predicted, will one day go public and eventually \u201cbecome the most valuable company in the world.\u201dNvidia reported $46.7 billion in revenue during its July-ending quarter (and crossed $4 trillion in market cap), while OpenAI doesn\u2019t expect to turn a profit until 2029. But by divesting of Nvidia and doubling down on OpenAI, Son can play a more active role in the platform\u2019s expansion via initiatives like the Stargate Project, which will finance a major buildout of AI infrastructure.SoftBank is still indirectly entwined in Nvidia\u2019s fortunes, which also rest on the broad expansion of AI. The entire stock market is being propped up by confidence in Big Tech companies that are investing huge amounts in AI. Investors are placing a lot of faith in the idea that generative AI, a mostly unproven technology, will create valuable new efficiencies for businesses in the coming years.Compounding the concern is the fact that a relatively small group of wealthy companies\u2014SoftBank, Nvidia, and OpenAI\u2014are investing in each other, which has fed fears that they\u2019re involved in a sort of self-inflating bubble.It\u2019s unclear if or when that bubble will pop. For now, Son has made his preference clear: software over hardware, a bet that feels like a big vote of confidence for AI.", "country": ["united states of america"], "category": ["business", "top"], "pubDate": "2025-11-12 00:13:54", "source_id": "fastcompany", "source_name": "Fast Company"}, "fa058f6792f92b64c92410b611fdc702": {"link": "https://thenightly.com.au/lifestyle/wellbeing/washington-post-even-small-amounts-of-exercise-can-boost-your-mood-and-reduce-your-risk-of-depression--c-20558489", "title": "THE WASHINGTON POST: Even small amounts of exercise can boost your mood and reduce your risk of depression", "description": "THE WASHINGTON POST: Feeling low?

The parks have come a looong way since back in the day.I should know. I'm a fan and have just come back from one.I applied my trademark two-hour weekend driving rule and headed to Kiama on the NSW south coast. READ MORE: Two 'secret' words that will unlock the perfect weekend escape\ufeff\ufeffThere are plenty of holiday park options in and around Kiama but I chose Kendalls on the Beach a few minutes drive or 20-minute walk from the town centre.Kendalls is right on the beach as advertised. Step out your front door of the beachfront cabins and boom you're good to go.READ MORE: Aussie favourite crowned the best country for 'island-hopping' in the worldUnfortunately, I booked late and couldn't get a beachfront but got a 2-bedroom garden spa on the next line back. This was a big, roomy cabin. Full-size kitchen, spa, laundry facilities, air conditioning, two big lounges and two TVs.Outside was a deck, 7-piece outdoor setting and a barbecue. All this for the price of a hotel room.READ MORE: How to get 53 days off without using any extra annual leave in 2026For a family on holidays a cabin is a no-brainer. Our place had a double master and four bunks in the second bedroom.You can cook meals at home which is a huge saving for a family if the alternative is to eat out three meals a day. The savings also apply if you're a couple and it means you've got a lot more space to stretch out than at the motel down the street.Kendalls also has caravan sites if you prefer BYO accommodation plus powered and unpowered tent sites.Things to do in Kiama\ufeffOK, base sorted. Time to see what Kiama offers these days. It didn't take long.Kendalls is right on the Kiama Coastal Walk which runs for 20kms from the Minnamurra River to Werri Beach in Gerringong. I used the path to get into town and it's a very scenic walk. Saw a migrating whale and lots of locals and visitors getting up their steps.The famous Kiama Blowhole is five minutes walk up the hill from town. It's the big ticket attraction and even on a pretty calm day it still delivered a few good wooshes of water and selfie opportunities. Lunch. Kiama is an old fishing village so seafood seemed to make sense. I did some Googling and came up with a fish 'n' chip shop called By The Sea on the main drag, Terralong Street.Take-away and eat in. I had grilled barramundi and chips for $18 which has to be at least half what you'd pay in a restaurant. Perfectly cooked fish and golden, crispy chips. Kiama is compact and easy to get around. Nice mix of cafes and boutiques, a few pubs and the Kiama Leagues Club right in the middle of town. Local enough to not feel touristy and touristy enough to accommodate visitors. Having resisted driving all day it was time to get in the car and have a look at the surrounding attractions. Gerringong\ufeffTwelve-minutes drive further south is the pretty little town of Gerringong. A little run of shops and cafes topped off by The Hill Bar & Kitchen on the crest of the hill on Fern St with views across to Werri Beach and another perfectly-positioned holiday park if you prefer a spot quieter than Kiama.Gerringong\ufeff is also a noted whale-spotting location and they've even built a dedicated whale watching platform on the headland.GerroaFive minutes further south is Gerroa. There's no town centre as such but Gerroa's main attraction is stunning Seven Mile Beach which, true to its name, is actually 12-kilometres long. As you might have guessed there's also another holiday park in a prime location at the mouth of the Crooked River just behind the beach.But the one place everyone wanted to tell me about was the Gerroa Boat Fisherman's Club.Views across to Seven Mile Beach and as you'd expect a reputation for great seafood headlined by the Surf & Turf, a $48 wonder comprising a 300g rump, garlic prawns, fresh prawns, salt and pepper squid and chips.Bombo\ufeffI finished up sightseeing duties the next day with an eight-minute drive north of Kiama to Bombo Headland Quarry Geological Site which features some spectacular rock formations. I'd been to Kiama many times before and didn't know this existed. It's a bit of a walk in from the car park but worth the exercise.Still had time, though, for one last seafood meal. This one at Cargo Fish & Chips on Kiama Wharf which is obviously a locals' favourite judging by the pelicans which wandered in looking for a feed.Last tip. If you don't want to drive, this part of the world is exceptionally well serviced by trains from Sydney. Kiama, Gerringong\ufeff and Bombo all have stations which isn't something you often see outside the capital cities. If Kiama's not an option for you don't worry there are plenty of excellent holiday parks within easy driving range of wherever you are reading this.

Goldman said recent policy discussions around RMB internationalisation underscore Beijing\u2019s commitment to FX management, suggesting a preference for gradual yuan appreciation over large-scale stimulus.In its Q3 monetary policy report released on 11 November, the PBOC kept its \u201cmoderately loose\u201d stance but emphasised cross-cyclical adjustments, which Goldman views as signalling a less dovish approach. The report also downplayed loan growth, pointing to a shift toward direct financing and the local government debt swap program as structural priorities.Goldman added that CNY appreciation against the USD is expected to remain \u201cgradual and choppy,\u201d with the US dollar\u2019s trajectory remaining the dominant driver. A faster rise in the yuan, the bank said, would require a clearer catalyst, such as exporter repatriation flows near year-end \u2014 a pattern observed in September.The PBOC\u2019s reference to maintaining exchange rate \u201cflexibility\u201d rather than \u201cresilience\u201d suggests reduced depreciation pressure, with Goldman concluding that FX stability is unlikely to constrain measured policy easing next year.

The EV Crossovers relied on their championship pedigree, refusing to back down even when the Solar Spikers appeared poised to close the door in the fifth set.At the heart of the Crossovers\u2019 fight was Yuni Batista, who played like a woman on a mission. Not initially counted among the top-ranked reinforcements after the first of the two-round prelims, Batista unleashed a tournament-best 41 points, none bigger than the decisive final hit \u2013 a shot that bounced off a defender into the hands of Capital1 coach Jorge De Brito, sealing the thriller of a win.The fifth set alone epitomized the drama: with Chery Tiggo ahead, 14-11, Capital1 mounted a furious rally to 13-14, capitalizing on a rare Batista mishit. But the Crossovers\u2019 resilience shone through. After her first attempt was dug by the Solar Spikers, Batista calmly reset, as Jen Nierva dug a Capital1 attack and delivered a pass to Alina Bicar, who set up Batista for the clinching point. She didn\u2019t hesitate \u2013 she delivered.\u201cI didn\u2019t think too much, I just took it point by point,\u201d said Batista when asked about her mindset during the final stretch.Batista\u2019s heroics didn\u2019t just clinch the win \u2013 they also rewrote the record books. With a 43-percent attack efficiency, she set a new tournament scoring mark, surpassing Sasha Bytsenko\u2019s previous 38-point output. Capital1\u2019s own import scored 34 points, but ultimately had to take a backseat to Batista\u2019s explosive performance.The victory halted Chery Tiggo\u2019s slump and reignited its drive for a quarterfinal berth, improving its record to 2-4, good for a share of ninth place alongside the Choco Mucho Flying Titans. While still outside the top tier, the Crossovers\u2019 win brought them closer to the joint fifth-running Akari Chargers, Petro Gazz Angels and Solar Spikers \u2013 each toting 3-3 marks, setting up an intense race as the tournament enters the final stretch of the two-round preliminaries.While the victory did not dramatically alter their standing, it breathed life into Chery Tiggo\u2019s campaign, keeping the EV Crossovers\u2019 quarterfinal hopes flickering.\u201cThis win is so important to us. We continue to have to go to the quarterfinals,\u201d said Batista.After finishing in the bottom three in the first phase, the Crossovers knew they had little room for error in the second round \u2013 and their performance against Capital1 reflected that urgency. Led by a balanced offensive and a more disciplined floor defense, Chery Tiggo showed composure in key stretches, particularly in the tight opening and closing sets.The Crossovers seized control early in the first frame with clutch hitting and timely defensive stops to eke out a 26-24 win, before dropping the second set in a close 23-25 decision. But they regrouped masterfully in the third, dominating 25-12 behind a renewed sense of purpose and aggressive serving that kept the Solar Spikers off balance.But Capital1 regrouped in the fourth set, mounting a late surge that forced the match into a decider \u2013 the fifth match to go the distance in this year-ending PVL Reinforced Conference, organized by Sports Vision and supported by ICTSI, Milcu, Mikasa and Fabriano.Backing Batista\u2019s dominant performance, Ara Galang contributed 11 points, while Shaya Adorador added seven. Mylene Paat, Renee Pen\u0303afiel, and Cza Carandang chipped in six points apiece, helping the EV Crossovers match the Solar Spikers\u2019 72 attacks \u2013 a testament to how evenly contested the match was.Capital1 edged the Crossovers in blocks, 11-9, but Chery Tiggo capitalized on its rival\u2019s errors, converting 30 free points while giving up only 15 from their own mistakes.Despite the Crossovers\u2019 advantage in points off errors, the Solar Spikers kept the contest close until the very end. Rookie Bella Belen shone with a career-high 22 points, and Chel Austero added 11 markers, proving that Capital1 remained a formidable opponent even in defeat.

In 2022, Lego designed an awesome 1,222-piece Tallneck based on the Machine's appearance in Horizon Forbidden West.Unfortunately, the Tallneck was discontinued by Lego at the end of 2023. It was still possible to find the Tallneck at Amazon last year, but the retailer sold out over the holidays due to a Black Friday discount. Reseller prices have risen throughout 2025; sellers on Amazon's marketplace are currently asking $160 for the Tallneck. At face value, this price may sound too outlandish for a large Lego model designed for adults, but the Tallneck originally retailed for $90. Despite the inflated cost, Amazon's store page notes 100-plus units sold over the last 30 days.If you haven't played the Lego Horizon Adventures video game, physical editions for PS5 and Nintendo Switch are available for low prices at multiple retailers.Lego Horizon Adventures for PS5Woot -- $22 ($40)Amazon -- $31.49 ($40)Lego Horizon Adventures for SwitchAmazon -- $26.86 ($40)Walmart -- $26.87 ($40) Sign up for GameSpot's Weekly Deals Newsletter:", "country": ["united states of america"], "category": ["entertainment"], "pubDate": "2025-11-12 00:01:00", "source_id": "gamespot", "source_name": "Gamespot"}, "addbb40389611885db1e33df546aef28": {"link": "https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/37289860/dua-lipa-taylor-swift-charli-xcx-boost-uk-economy/", "title": "Massive sum Dua Lipa, Taylor Swift and Charli XCX helped to add to UK economy last year revealed", "description": "DUA Lipa helped music boost the UK economy to the tune of \u00a38billion last year.

After the Godrej Group\u2019s split in April 2024 into Godrej Enterprises Group (GEG) and Godrej Industries Group (GIG), the flagship company, Godrej & Boyce, now part of GEG, began sharpening its focus on innovation-led manufacturing and design.Among its many verticals, one brand is quietly but confidently redefining how Indians think about furniture: Godrej Interio.Born out of Godrej & Boyce\u2019s manufacturing heritage that dates back to 1923, Interio has long been synonymous with reliability and craftsmanship. But with its new brand identity unveiled in October 2025 and the relaunch of its flagship store in Mumbai\u2019s Vikhroli not just as a store but as an experiential design destination, the brand seems to be asking a bigger question: What does furniture mean in the age of personal expression?A growing market for design-led livingThis brand evolution comes as the Indian furniture market enters a period of rapid expansion. Valued at around USD 23.8 billion in 2024, it is projected to reach USD 44.2 billion by 2033 at a CAGR of 6.4%. Some estimates go further, forecasting growth from USD 30.6 billion in 2025 to USD 64.1 billion by 2032, at a CAGR of 11.1%\u2014reflecting India\u2019s growing appetite for design-forward, functional living spaces.In this expanding landscape, Godrej Interio leads the organised segment with a 15% share, aiming to cross 20%, as per ET Retail. Competitors like IKEA, Durian, Urban Ladder, Pepperfry and Nilkamal are also intensifying their omnichannel and design-led play.From functionality to experienceSpread across 22,000 square feet, Interio\u2019s Vikhroli flagship feels less like a store and more like a lived-in design journal.A mangrove kitchen cafe\u0301, inspired by the surrounding Vikhroli mangroves, ties the space back to its local ecology, while an outdoor furniture collection brings attention to how city balconies and terraces are evolving into personal sanctuaries. The store also experiments with newer categories of kids' furniture and gaming rooms that mirror contemporary lifestyles shaped by play, performance and comfort. A section devoted to soft furnishings, from Bauhaus-inspired geometry to Naga weaves and tactile knits, adds texture and narrative, reminding visitors that design, at its best, is as much about expression as it is about utility.\u201cWe\u2019re moving from simply making furniture to designing experiences that reflect individuality, pace and belonging,\u201d says Reshu Saraf, Head of Marketing at Godrej Interio. \u201cIndian homes today are deeply personal and expressive, and we want Interio to evolve to meet that sentiment.\u201dIt\u2019s a telling statement from a brand that once stood for durability above all else. The new Interio aims to merge that legacy of craftsmanship with the aesthetics and agility of a design-led lifestyle brand. A digital soul in a physical spaceFurniture shopping by nature has always been tactile. But Interio\u2019s new model fuses that physical intimacy with a robust digital backbone. The revamped online platform features AI-powered discovery, 360\u00b0 walkthroughs, a 3D room planner, and even a GenAI chatbot to help customers visualise and personalise designs.\u201cConvenience is non-negotiable,\u201d Saraf says. \u201cOver 15% of our furniture revenue now comes from online sales, and almost 30% of that comes from our e-commerce platform.\u201dCustomers can now switch seamlessly between store visits, online browsing and video consultations with design experts.Crafting an Indian aesthetic for a global mindsetEven as Godrej Interio embraces modernity, it hasn\u2019t turned its back on Indian craft.The brand has collaborated with artisans and handicraft organisations across the country to reinterpret traditional techniques for modern homes, such as reimagining Naga weaves for soft furnishings or fusing geometric patterns inspired by Bauhaus with Indian motifs.\u201cCollaborating with Indian artisans allows us to offer designs that are culturally rooted yet globally relevant,\u201d Saraf explains. \u201cIt\u2019s about modern Indian homes that don\u2019t want imported aesthetics; they want authenticity, but reinterpreted for now.\u201dFrom TV to OTT to touchpoints at homeIf Interio\u2019s design language has changed, so has the way it speaks. The brand\u2019s media mix has turned decisively digital: 60% of total spends now go to digital channels, with 40\u201345% funnelled into connected TV and OTT platforms.Out-of-home presence at major airports in Delhi, Mumbai and Kolkata ensures the brand remains visible to the urban consumer while constantly in motion.The next phase for Interio is expansion at scale. With a presence across 1,000 stores in more than 600 cities and delivery reaching 18,000+ pin codes, the company plans to add around 300 new showrooms over the next three years. The focus is on deepening access beyond metros into Tier 2 and 3 markets, while steadily increasing the share of products that meet green certification standards, currently targeted at 60\u201365% of its portfolio.A quiet revolution in the makingWhat makes this shift notable is that it\u2019s unfolding within a company that has witnessed India\u2019s changing idea of home for more than a century. For Godrej Interio, the transformation isn\u2019t about reinvention for reinvention\u2019s sake, but about reinterpreting what it already understands about how Indians live, work, and express identity through their spaces.As Saraf puts it, the focus ahead is on \u201cmass personalisation at scale anchored in the vision of Design for Modern India\u201d.In that sense, Interio\u2019s evolution feels less like a rebrand and more like a reflection of the times: a heritage name learning to speak the design language of a younger, more expressive India.", "country": ["india"], "category": ["business"], "pubDate": "2025-11-12 00:00:37", "source_id": "afaqs", "source_name": "Afaqs"}, "26972caa5270b92e464c2849fa29b8ff": {"link": "https://hackaday.com/2025/11/11/emulating-a-74ls48-bcd-to-7-segment-decoder-driver-with-an-altera-max-7000-s-series-complex-programmable-logic-device/", "title": "Emulating a 74LS48 BCD-to-7-Segment Decoder/Driver with an Altera MAX 7000 \u201cS\u201d Series Complex Programmable Logic Device", "description": "Over on the [Behind The Code with Gerry] YouTube channel our hacker [Gerry] shows us how to emulate a 74LS48 BCD-to-7-segment decoder/driver using an Altera CPLD Logic Chip From 1998. ...read more", "country": ["united states of america"], "category": ["technology"], "pubDate": "2025-11-12 00:00:36", "source_id": "hackaday", "source_name": "Hackaday"}, "b7858000506fc7197cc02da1d53615e6": {"link": "https://www.wxyz.com/news/vietnam-war-veterans-honor-decades-long-friendship-that-began-in-middle-school", "title": "Vietnam War veterans honor decades-long friendship that began in middle school", "description": "Two Vietnam veteran doctors celebrate a 75-year friendship that began in middle school and continued through war service and medical careers.", "country": ["united states of america"], "category": ["lifestyle", "top"], "pubDate": "2025-11-12 00:00:36", "source_id": "wxyz", "source_name": "Wxyz"}, "e551e45f46528c1c25086d196ad90ecf": {"link": "https://www.theborneopost.com/2025/11/12/sdec-unveils-malaysias-first-ai-powered-unmanned-mart/", "title": "SDEC unveils Malaysia\u2019s first AI-powered unmanned mart", "description": "KUCHING (Nov 12): Sarawak Digital Economy Corporation Berhad (SDEC) officially launched the TAP & GO Mart, Malaysia\u2019s first fully commercialised unmanned mart, at Baitulmakmur Building II here yesterday.

Trump\u2019s attorney threatened a $1 billion lawsuit on the British Broadcasting Corporation Tuesday over a doctored clip of Trump speaking to his beloved Jan. 6 insurrectionists.If the outlet doesn\u2019t comply with their demands\u2014including issuing an apology and paying Trump an \u201cappropriate\u201d amount of money\u2014it will be added to a growing list of outlets embroiled in legal trouble with Trump.President Donald TrumpEarlier this month, a leaked memo from BBC employee Michael Prescott claimed that a 2024 clip tarnished Trump\u2019s character by changing what he said outside of the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, implying that he incited the violent insurrection.\u201cWe're going to walk down to the Capitol, and I'll be there with you. And we fight. We fight like hell,\u201d Trump said in the clip.But Trump really said, \u201cWe're going to walk down to the Capitol, and we're going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women.\"BBC Chair Samir Shah said in a publicly shared letter that \u201cthe way the speech was edited did give the impression of a direct call for violent action.\u201dHowever, he said that the purpose of the spliced video was to \u201cconvey the message of the speech\u201d so viewers could \u201cunderstand how it had been received by President Trump's supporters and what was happening on the ground at that time.\u201dHe also apologized for the BBC\u2019s \u201cerror of judgement.\u201dFirst off, Trump\u2019s legal attack on the BBC doesn\u2019t hold much ground since the documentary was aired in 2024, passing the one-year deadline to file, and it didn\u2019t appear to even make it to U.S. markets. \u201cOur journalists are hardworking people who strive for impartiality, and I will stand by their journalism,\u201d CEO Deborah Turness, who resigned alongside Director General Tim Davie, said Monday. \u201cThere is no institutional bias. Mistakes are made, but there\u2019s no institutional bias.\u201dBut Trump has been on a war path targeting media outlets\u2014and in some aspects, he\u2019s won. Trump successfully sued Paramount over an edited \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris. He\u2019s also claimed $15 million from ABC over a 2024 defamation lawsuit. Overall, he has claimed more than $90 million in legal cases brought against the media. While the shift of mainstream media is more nuanced than just avoiding punitive action, billionaires in media will always be watching their bottom line. And Trump clearly isn\u2019t shy about threatening money to shut them up.Now that Trump's attack on the media has gone international, the future of free press isn\u2019t looking good.", "country": ["united states of america"], "category": ["politics"], "pubDate": "2025-11-12 00:00:04", "source_id": "dailykos", "source_name": "Dailykos"}, "e7081e95508f07ea8ec1f65c59f461d5": {"link": "https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiwFBVV95cUxPVE5ab2NETnp2dkpwVUduQWdOQ3JXLUlXMzgwVG9kZWROODA2VHpTTWo0WGN3QktLeG9VV2ZzdWV4alhpaERhaTZrQzdHVlpLa1RWZFdDa0NSRUxOaGpoSTZLNUF3cUFRSlZpYWRFZUdkSFMtV1UwQWFBZlNWNWZKMnp3Rk5lU3J0SXhN?oc=5", "title": "Newly identified lymphoma subtype gives hope in fight against aggressive form of blood cancer - Medical Xpress", "description": "Newly identified lymphoma subtype gives hope in fight against aggressive form of blood cancer Medical Xpress", "country": ["singapore"], "category": ["health"], "pubDate": "2025-11-12 00:00:03", "source_id": "google", "source_name": "Google News"}, "0183e7db6cbc86ad4c281735de92c3b4": {"link": "https://thehockeynews.com/nashville-predators/latest-news/forsberg-and-wilsby-hope-global-series-will-breathe-new-life-into-predators", "title": "Forsberg And Wilsby Hope Global Series Will Breathe New Life Into Predators", "description": "Filip Forsberg and Adam Wilsby have an opportunity to play two NHL games in their home country of Sweden.

The full judgment can be read here: Aston Martin MENA Limited v Aston Martin Lagonda Limited [2025] EWHC 2531 (Comm).The FactsAston Martin Lagonda Limited (AML) entered into an exclusive distribution agreement with Aston Martin MENA Limited (AMMENA), an independent third party, for a defined territory in the Middle East and North Africa. The agreement granted AMMENA the right to purchase Aston Martin vehicles from AML for resale within the territory and imposed various obligations on both parties concerning pricing, marketing, and the maintenance of brand standards consistent with Aston Martin\u2019s global image.A dispute arose over the interpretation of the pricing mechanism, which resulted in an arbitration pursuant to the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) Rules. After a lengthy submissions phase, and a 2-week merits hearing, a 3-person Tribunal rendered an award, including 140 pages of well-structured, clear reasoning (the Award). The dispositive part of the Award, decided a number of individual points, of which AMMENA challenged just one, relating to a specific aspect of the interpretation of a single provision: Article 4A(1).The Issues and the AwardArticle 4A(1) provided:\u201c... the price for Products shall be set on a regional basis so that (a) the Company\u2019s price for export (from its UK premises) to the Territory in force at the time of delivery shall not be materially higher than the UK factory price applicable to other territories ...\u201dThe dispute relevant to the provision centred on whether the phrase \u201cthe UK factory price applicable to other territories\u201d referred to the internal transfer price (ITP) Aston Martin Lagonda (AML) used in dealings with its own intra-group distributors, or to the prices charged to independent third-party distributors operating at arm\u2019s length (referred to as the Dealer Net Price (DNP)).AMMENA argued that being charged the DNP put it at a commercial disadvantage in its region, and that it should therefore be charged the ITP in line with those applied to AML\u2019s Chinese and North American intra-group distributors. AML maintained that since AMMENA was not an intra-group distributor, it was entitled to charge the DNP, reflecting the parties\u2019 commercial arm\u2019s length relationship.The Tribunal sided with AML.The Section 69 AppealAMMENA sought leave to appeal the Award, under Section 69(3)(c)(i) of the Act, on the basis that the Tribunal\u2019s contractual interpretation was \u201cobviously wrong\u201d. Mr Justice Robin Knowles granted permission, and the case came before Mr Justice Bright for a decision on the merits of the appeal.On appeal, AML argued that since the test for leave to appeal under Section 69(3)(c)(i) of the Act is whether the Award was \u201cobviously wrong\u201d, it is that same threshold that the Court must entertain to allow the appeal. The Court disagreed and found that it need only be satisfied that the response the Tribunal gave to the question of contractual interpretation was \u201cwrong and that the question of law that the appeal identifies should now be given a different answer\u201d.The Court also found that while it was well equipped to interpret the natural meaning of the words used in the Distribution Agreement, it was not as well placed as the Tribunal was to evaluate the factual matrix. Contractual interpretation is \u201ca mixed question of law and fact\u201d, and while the \u201cthe nature and character of that mixture will vary from case to case\u201d, where the factual matrix is of high importance, and the Court \u201csimply do[es] not know as much about ... the factual matrix as the Tribunal did\u201d, \u201cit may be right for the Court to be slow to be persuaded to overturn [a] Tribunal\u2019s conclusion\u201d.AMMENA\u2019s appeal was therefore dismissed.Concluding RemarksThe Court\u2019s decision reaffirms two key principles for Section 69 Arbitration Act appeals that companies and practitioners should keep in mind:First, the threshold for success on appeal is lower than the threshold for leave to appeal.Second, the judgment underscores the Courts\u2019 deference to arbitral findings, particularly where contractual interpretation depends on a complex factual matrix.Our international disputes team is on hand to assist with any queries following this decision.", "country": ["united states of america"], "category": ["world"], "pubDate": "2025-11-12 00:00:00", "source_id": "akingump", "source_name": "Akin"}, "43b3df994fb9676faaaa73ffe093cfc8": {"link": "https://www.thestar.com.my/opinion/columnists/all-the-pieces-matter/2025/11/12/shifting-battle-lines-of-democracy", "title": "Shifting battle lines of democracy", "description": "The recent election results in America give some hints as to the direction democracy may be headed.

According to documentation released with the model, this design allows it to match or exceed the performance of much larger competing systems on tasks involving document understanding, chart analysis, and visual reasoning while consuming significantly less computational power and memory.\"Built upon the powerful ERNIE-4.5-VL-28B-A3B architecture, the newly upgraded ERNIE-4.5-VL-28B-A3B-Thinking achieves a remarkable leap forward in multimodal reasoning capabilities,\" Baidu wrote in the model's technical documentation on Hugging Face, the AI model repository where the system was released.The company said the model underwent \"an extensive mid-training phase\" that incorporated \"a vast and highly diverse corpus of premium visual-language reasoning data,\" dramatically boosting its ability to align visual and textual information semantically.How the model mimics human visual problem-solving through dynamic image analysisPerhaps the model's most distinctive feature is what Baidu calls \"Thinking with Images\" \u2014 a capability that allows the AI to dynamically zoom in and out of images to examine fine-grained details, mimicking how humans approach visual problem-solving tasks.\"The model thinks like a human, capable of freely zooming in and out of images to grasp every detail and uncover all information,\" according to the model card. When paired with tools like image search, Baidu claims this feature \"dramatically elevates the model's ability to process fine-grained details and handle long-tail visual knowledge.\"This approach marks a departure from traditional vision-language models, which typically process images at a fixed resolution. By allowing dynamic image examination, the system can theoretically handle scenarios requiring both broad context and granular detail\u2014such as analyzing complex technical diagrams or detecting subtle defects in manufacturing quality control.The model also supports what Baidu describes as enhanced \"visual grounding\" capabilities with \"more precise grounding and flexible instruction execution, easily triggering grounding functions in complex industrial scenarios,\" suggesting potential applications in robotics, warehouse automation, and other settings where AI systems must identify and locate specific objects in visual scenes.Baidu's performance claims draw scrutiny as independent testing remains pendingBaidu's assertion that the model outperforms Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro and OpenAI's GPT-5-High on various document and chart understanding benchmarks has drawn attention across social media, though independent verification of these claims remains pending.The company released the model under the permissive Apache 2.0 license, allowing unrestricted commercial use\u2014a strategic decision that contrasts with the more restrictive licensing approaches of some competitors and could accelerate enterprise adoption.\"Apache 2.0 is smart,\" wrote one X user responding to Baidu's announcement, highlighting the competitive advantage of open licensing in the enterprise market.According to Baidu's documentation, the model demonstrates six core capabilities beyond traditional text processing. In visual reasoning, the system can perform what Baidu describes as \"multi-step reasoning, chart analysis, and causal reasoning capabilities in complex visual tasks,\" aided by what the company characterizes as \"large-scale reinforcement learning.\" For STEM problem solving, Baidu claims that \"leveraging its powerful visual abilities, the model achieves a leap in performance on STEM tasks like solving problems from photos.\" The visual grounding capability allows the model to identify and locate objects within images with what Baidu characterizes as industrial-grade precision. Through tool integration, the system can invoke external functions including image search capabilities to access information beyond its training data.For video understanding, Baidu claims the model possesses \"outstanding temporal awareness and event localization abilities, accurately identifying content changes across different time segments in a video.\" Finally, the thinking with images feature enables the dynamic zoom functionality that distinguishes this model from competitors.Inside the mixture-of-experts architecture that powers efficient multimodal processingUnder the hood, ERNIE-4.5-VL-28B-A3B-Thinking employs a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture \u2014 a design pattern that has become increasingly popular for building efficient large-scale AI systems. Rather than activating all 28 billion parameters for every task, the model uses a routing mechanism to selectively activate only the 3 billion parameters most relevant to each specific input.This approach offers substantial practical advantages for enterprise deployments. According to Baidu's documentation, the model can run on a single 80GB GPU \u2014 hardware readily available in many corporate data centers \u2014 making it significantly more accessible than competing systems that may require multiple high-end accelerators.The technical documentation reveals that Baidu employed several advanced training techniques to achieve the model's capabilities. The company used \"cutting-edge multimodal reinforcement learning techniques on verifiable tasks, integrating GSPO and IcePop strategies to stabilize MoE training combined with dynamic difficulty sampling for exceptional learning efficiency.\"Baidu also notes that in response to \"strong community demand,\" the company \"significantly strengthened the model's grounding performance with improved instruction-following capabilities.\"The new model fits into Baidu's ambitious multimodal AI ecosystemThe new release is one component of Baidu's broader ERNIE 4.5 model family, which the company unveiled in June 2025. That family comprises 10 distinct variants, including Mixture-of-Experts models ranging from the flagship ERNIE-4.5-VL-424B-A47B with 424 billion total parameters down to a compact 0.3 billion parameter dense model.According to Baidu's technical report on the ERNIE 4.5 family, the models incorporate \"a novel heterogeneous modality structure, which supports parameter sharing across modalities while also allowing dedicated parameters for each individual modality.\"This architectural choice addresses a longstanding challenge in multimodal AI development: training systems on both visual and textual data without one modality degrading the performance of the other. Baidu claims this design \"has the advantage to enhance multimodal understanding without compromising, and even improving, performance on text-related tasks.\"The company reported achieving 47% Model FLOPs Utilization (MFU) \u2014 a measure of training efficiency \u2014 during pre-training of its largest ERNIE 4.5 language model, using the PaddlePaddle deep learning framework developed in-house.Comprehensive developer tools aim to simplify enterprise deployment and integrationFor organizations looking to deploy the model, Baidu has released a comprehensive suite of development tools through ERNIEKit, what the company describes as an \"industrial-grade training and compression development toolkit.\"The model offers full compatibility with popular open-source frameworks including Hugging Face Transformers, vLLM (a high-performance inference engine), and Baidu's own FastDeploy toolkit. This multi-platform support could prove critical for enterprise adoption, allowing organizations to integrate the model into existing AI infrastructure without wholesale platform changes.Sample code released by Baidu shows a relatively straightforward implementation path. Using the Transformers library, developers can load and run the model with approximately 30 lines of Python code, according to the documentation on Hugging Face.For production deployments requiring higher throughput, Baidu provides vLLM integration with specialized support for the model's \"reasoning-parser\" and \"tool-call-parser\" capabilities\u2014features that enable the dynamic image examination and external tool integration that distinguish this model from earlier systems.The company also offers FastDeploy, a proprietary inference toolkit that Baidu claims delivers \"production-ready, easy-to-use multi-hardware deployment solutions\" with support for various quantization schemes that can reduce memory requirements and increase inference speed.Why this release matters for the enterprise AI market at a critical inflection pointThe release comes at a pivotal moment in the enterprise AI market. As organizations move beyond experimental chatbot deployments toward production systems that process documents, analyze visual data, and automate complex workflows, demand for capable and cost-effective vision-language models has intensified.Several enterprise use cases appear particularly well-suited to the model's capabilities. Document processing \u2014 extracting information from invoices, contracts, and forms \u2014 represents a massive market where accurate chart and table understanding directly translates to cost savings through automation. Manufacturing quality control, where AI systems must detect visual defects, could benefit from the model's grounding capabilities. Customer service applications that handle images from users could leverage the multi-step visual reasoning.The model's efficiency profile may prove especially attractive to mid-market organizations and startups that lack the computing budgets of large technology companies. By fitting on a single 80GB GPU \u2014 hardware costing roughly $10,000 to $30,000 depending on the specific model \u2014 the system becomes economically viable for a much broader range of organizations than models requiring multi-GPU setups costing hundreds of thousands of dollars.\"With all these new models, where's the best place to actually build and scale? Access to compute is everything,\" wrote one X user in response to Baidu's announcement, highlighting the persistent infrastructure challenges facing organizations attempting to deploy advanced AI systems.The Apache 2.0 licensing further lowers barriers to adoption. Unlike models released under more restrictive licenses that may limit commercial use or require revenue sharing, organizations can deploy ERNIE-4.5-VL-28B-A3B-Thinking in production applications without ongoing licensing fees or usage restrictions.Competition intensifies as Chinese tech giant takes aim at Google and OpenAIBaidu's release intensifies competition in the vision-language model space, where Google, OpenAI, Anthropic, and Chinese companies including Alibaba and ByteDance have all released capable systems in recent months.The company's performance claims \u2014 if validated by independent testing \u2014 would represent a significant achievement. Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro and OpenAI's GPT-5-High are substantially larger models backed by the deep resources of two of the world's most valuable technology companies. That a more compact, openly available model could match or exceed their performance on specific tasks would suggest the field is advancing more rapidly than some analysts anticipated.\"Impressive that ERNIE is outperforming Gemini 2.5 Pro,\" wrote one social media commenter, expressing surprise at the claimed results.However, some observers counseled caution about benchmark comparisons. \"It's fascinating to see how multimodal models are evolving, especially with features like 'Thinking with Images,'\" wrote one X user. \"That said, I'm curious if ERNIE-4.5's edge over competitors like Gemini-2.5-Pro and GPT-5-High primarily lies in specific use cases like document and chart\" understanding rather than general-purpose vision tasks.Industry analysts note that benchmark performance often fails to capture real-world behavior across the diverse scenarios enterprises encounter. A model that excels at document understanding may struggle with creative visual tasks or real-time video analysis. Organizations evaluating these systems typically conduct extensive internal testing on representative workloads before committing to production deployments.Technical limitations and infrastructure requirements that enterprises must considerDespite its capabilities, the model faces several technical challenges common to large vision-language systems. The minimum requirement of 80GB of GPU memory, while more accessible than some competitors, still represents a significant infrastructure investment. Organizations without existing GPU infrastructure would need to procure specialized hardware or rely on cloud computing services, introducing ongoing operational costs.The model's context window \u2014 the amount of text and visual information it can process simultaneously \u2014 is listed as 128K tokens in Baidu's documentation. While substantial, this may prove limiting for some document processing scenarios involving very long technical manuals or extensive video content.Questions also remain about the model's behavior on adversarial inputs, out-of-distribution data, and edge cases. Baidu's documentation does not provide detailed information about safety testing, bias mitigation, or failure modes \u2014 considerations increasingly important for enterprise deployments where errors could have financial or safety implications.What technical decision-makers need to evaluate beyond the benchmark numbersFor technical decision-makers evaluating the model, several implementation factors warrant consideration beyond raw performance metrics.The model's MoE architecture, while efficient during inference, adds complexity to deployment and optimization. Organizations must ensure their infrastructure can properly route inputs to the appropriate expert subnetworks \u2014 a capability not universally supported across all deployment platforms.The \"Thinking with Images\" feature, while innovative, requires integration with image manipulation tools to achieve its full potential. Baidu's documentation suggests this capability works best \"when paired with tools like image zooming and image search,\" implying that organizations may need to build additional infrastructure to fully leverage this functionality.The model's video understanding capabilities, while highlighted in marketing materials, come with practical constraints. Processing video requires substantially more computational resources than static images, and the documentation does not specify maximum video length or optimal frame rates.Organizations considering deployment should also evaluate Baidu's ongoing commitment to the model. Open-source AI models require continuing maintenance, security updates, and potential retraining as data distributions shift over time. While the Apache 2.0 license ensures the model remains available, future improvements and support depend on Baidu's strategic priorities.Developer community responds with enthusiasm tempered by practical requestsEarly response from the AI research and development community has been cautiously optimistic. Developers have requested versions of the model in additional formats including GGUF (a quantization format popular for local deployment) and MNN (a mobile neural network framework), suggesting interest in running the system on resource-constrained devices.\"Release MNN and GGUF so I can run it on my phone,\" wrote one developer, highlighting demand for mobile deployment options.Other developers praised Baidu's technical choices while requesting additional resources. \"Fantastic model! Did you use discoveries from PaddleOCR?\" asked one user, referencing Baidu's open-source optical character recognition toolkit.The model's lengthy name\u2014ERNIE-4.5-VL-28B-A3B-Thinking\u2014drew lighthearted commentary. \"ERNIE-4.5-VL-28B-A3B-Thinking might be the longest model name in history,\" joked one observer. \"But hey, if you're outperforming Gemini-2.5-Pro with only 3B active params, you've earned the right to a dramatic name!\"Baidu plans to showcase the ERNIE lineup during its Baidu World 2025 conference on November 13, where the company is expected to provide additional details about the model's development, performance validation, and future roadmap.The release marks a strategic move by Baidu to establish itself as a major player in the global AI infrastructure market. While Chinese AI companies have historically focused primarily on domestic markets, the open-source release under a permissive license signals ambitions to compete internationally with Western AI giants.For enterprises, the release adds another capable option to a rapidly expanding menu of AI models. Organizations no longer face a binary choice between building proprietary systems or licensing closed-source models from a handful of vendors. The proliferation of capable open-source alternatives like ERNIE-4.5-VL-28B-A3B-Thinking is reshaping the economics of AI deployment and accelerating adoption across industries.Whether the model delivers on its performance promises in real-world deployments remains to be seen.

(Let\u2019s also blame Dallas general manager Nico Harrison for that egregious error.)Having played primarily at power forward and small forward at Duke, Flagg as a \u201cTemu Luka\u201d is averaging an uninspiring 13.9 points, 6.6 rebounds, and 3.0 assists per game, shooting 40.3 percent from the field and a paltry 27.0 percent from beyond the arc in his rookie campaign.It gets worse when you consider that backup point guard D\u2019Angelo Russell is dishing out more assists in fewer minutes\u20145.6 per game. Meanwhile, the Mavericks\u2019 statistical leaders this season are Anthony Davis in scoring, rebounding, and steals (20.8 points, 10.2 boards, and 1.6 swipes per game, respectively) and Daniel Gafford in blocks at 1.6 per outing.To say that Flagg is struggling to adjust to playing point guard in the NBA is an understatement\u2014and his frustration is starting to boil over.After a loss to the equally woeful New Orleans Pelicans, Flagg admitted:\u201cFor me, it's the most I've lost since... you know, I think ever. It\u2019s obviously a lot different\u2014you have to adapt to playing more games and getting used to that\u2014but I wouldn\u2019t say anybody\u2019s happy. Just speaking personally, it\u2019s not fun to just keep losing games.\u201dIf this continues, the Mavericks, Kidd, and Harrison can kiss their playoff\u2014or even championship\u2014dreams goodbye. As for Flagg, he\u2019ll likely lose the Rookie of the Year race to the 2025 NBA Draft\u2019s third overall pick, VJ Edgecombe, who\u2019s averaging 16.3 points, 5.8 rebounds, and 4.4 assists for the surprisingly upstart 6\u20134 Philadelphia 76ers.Compared to the 76ers, the once-proud Mavericks are off to a disastrous start in the Association\u2019s 50th season, sitting at 3\u20137 and ranking 14th in the Western Conference and fourth in the Southwest Division.With Irving in street clothes and Anthony Davis\u2014whom Charles Barkley once derisively nicknamed \u201cStreet Clothes\u201d\u2014sidelined the past five games due to a calf strain (I just had one playing pickleball, so I know how bad it hurts), Dallas ranks near the bottom in nearly every key statistical category.The Mavericks are 30th in points per game (106.5), 13th in rebounds (43.9), 27th in assists (23.8), 29th in field-goal percentage (44.5%), 30th in three-point percentage (30.7%), 8th in opponent points per game (113.3), 30th in offensive rating (106.5), 7th in defensive rating (110.5), and 25th in average score margin (minus 6.8), according to TeamRankings.While the absence of Davis clearly skews the defensive metrics, it\u2019s ironic that Doncic has a better defensive rating (110.5) than the Mavericks as a whole (113.3).So much for Harrison\u2019s infamous midseason quip after the Doncic-Davis trade: \u201cDefense wins championships.\u201dDallas\u2019 home jerseys are white, so should they wave the Flagg now?", "country": ["philippines"], "category": ["sports", "top"], "pubDate": "2025-11-11 23:57:12", "source_id": "manilatimes", "source_name": "The Manila Times"}, "e61de061b031872962157076ab891f67": {"link": "https://thehockeynews.com/ottawa-senators/game-day/jordan-spence-paired-with-thomas-chabot-again-as-senators-host-dallas-stars", "title": "Jordan Spence Paired With Thomas Chabot Again As Senators Host Dallas Stars", "description": "Spence starts alongside Chabot for the first time, looking to build on recent success against a tough Dallas Stars squad.", "country": ["united states of america"], "category": ["sports"], "pubDate": "2025-11-11 23:57:09", "source_id": "yahoo", "source_name": "Yahoo!

Using impeachment as retaliation for an unfavorable decision undermines the rule of law and the separation of powers that safeguard our system of government.\"\"The judiciary must remain free from political pressure so all Utahns can have confidence in fair, impartial courts. Impeachment is reserved for serious misconduct, and disagreement should instead be addressed through the appeals process,\" the statement concluded. \"We urge all public officials and Utahns to respect the role of the judiciary and the independence of Utah's courts.\"Gibson found the state legislature had violated Utah's Proposition 4, a measure passed by voters in 2018 to prohibit partisan gerrymandering. The legislature sidelined the advisory committee set up by the ballot measure and passed a map that split Salt Lake City into four pieces to ensure all districts would be heavily Republican-favoring.After Gibson ruled this illegal, and the Utah Supreme Court agreed, the legislature passed a new map that split Salt Lake County in two, keeping all four districts Republican-favoring, while passing a separate law that would override Proposition 4's fairness criteria and adopt new rules that require all Republican districts. They also threatened to impeach Gibson if she interfered again.Gibson, undeterred, found this week that both measures were also illegal and adopted a more compact, balanced map proposed by the plaintiffs that kept Salt Lake City whole.

Colorful northern lights have decorated night skies in unexpected places and space weather experts say there are more auroras still to come.Aurora displays known as the northern and southern lights are commonly visible near the poles, where charged particles from the sun interact with Earth\u2019s atmosphere.Skygazers are spotting the lights deeper into the United States and Europe because the sun is going through a major face-lift. Every 11 years, its poles swap places, causing magnetic twists and tangles along the way.Last year, the strongest geomagnetic storm in two decades slammed Earth, producing light displays across the Northern Hemisphere. And soon afterward, a powerful solar storm dazzled skygazers far from the Arctic Circle when dancing lights appeared in unexpected places including Germany, the United Kingdom, New England and New York City.The sun\u2019s active spurt is expected to last at least through the end of this year, though when solar activity will peak won\u2019t be known until months after the fact, according to NASA and NOAA.How solar storms affect EarthSolar storms can bring more than colorful lights to Earth.When fast-moving particles and plasma slam into Earth\u2019s magnetic field, they can temporarily disrupt the power grid. Space weather can also interfere with air traffic control radio and satellites in orbit. Severe storms are capable of scrambling other radio and GPS communications.In 1859, a severe solar storm triggered auroras as far south as Hawaii and set telegraph lines on fire in a rare event. And a 1972 solar storm may have detonated magnetic U.S. sea mines off the coast of Vietnam.Space weather experts aren\u2019t able to predict a solar storm months in advance.

Here's how", "description": "When Rajesh Jain began building India\u2019s first internet portals in the late 1990s, digital marketing was still an uncharted frontier. Two decades later, the founder and Group CEO of Netcore Cloud is once again attempting to redraw the industry\u2019s contours, this time by pushing marketing beyond automation and into what he calls the agentic era.Netcore Cloud, a bootstrapped \u201cproficorn\u201d with a reported annual recurring revenue of $100 million, works with more than 6,500 brands worldwide, including Unilever, Walmart, Domino\u2019s, Crocs and McDonald\u2019s. Its SaaS platform helps B2C companies drive engagement, retention and personalisation across multiple channels.Now, in partnership with Google Cloud, the company has unveiled what it calls the Next-Gen Agentic Marketing Stack, a system designed to help marketers move from reactive automation to autonomous, self-optimising intelligence.\u201cWe have already done quite a bit of work; deep integrations are in place,\u201d says Jain. \u201cGoogle Cloud helps bring us the cloud tech, which is the data storage and the AI models.\u201d Rajesh Jain, founder & group CEO, Netcore CloudThe unveiling, presented at the company\u2019s Agentic Marketing 2025 event, marks the beginning of what Netcore claims is marketing\u2019s next technological epoch: one where autonomous AI agents can run campaigns end to end, from ideation to execution, with minimal human intervention.From MarTech to agentic techIn marketing technology, or MarTech, automation has been the dominant theme for more than a decade. Platforms have made it easier to send personalised emails, target audiences and analyse campaign performance. But for Jain, this stage of evolution is already outdated.He argues that the industry is now moving into what he calls the agentic phase, where AI agents can take independent actions towards defined goals. Unlike traditional automation, which follows preset workflows, agentic AI can decide what needs to be done and when, based on real-time data.\u201cThe ability to combine data, decisioning, and then the activation of the delivery of messages,\u201d he says, \u201cis eventually about a simple idea; how do I get the right message to the right person at the right time so I can get a transaction done?\u201dThe stack that Netcore and Google Cloud have built sits atop large language models and generative AI frameworks. Jain explains that this system can bring together first-party customer data from web, app and CRM systems, link it with behavioural and contextual inputs, and activate personalised campaigns automatically across channels.The challenge of scale and relevanceOne of the biggest challenges that Netcore is trying to solve, Jain says, is the limitation of traditional segmentation. \u201cMarketing teams today create eight to ten segments,\u201d he explains. \u201cThese eight to ten segments can now become 500 segments, can become 1,000 segments.\u201dThrough agentic systems, the stack can automatically create these micro-segments, generate the right content for each and deploy the most effective journeys. The result, Jain believes, is a shift from N equals many to N equals one; from marketing to large cohorts to marketing to individuals in real time.This, he argues, changes the core dynamics of how marketing teams operate. \u201cYou can create hundreds or thousands of journeys, and agents can do this autonomously,\u201d he says. \u201cThey can keep optimising, testing and learning without waiting for manual inputs.\u201dTackling dormancyA major challenge Jain highlights is how brands handle dormant customers. In most organisations, once a consumer stops engaging or transacting, they are quickly moved into a retargeting funnel, often targeted again through paid ads or discount-driven campaigns. Jain argues that this approach is both inefficient and shortsighted.He explains that brands often fail to recognise the long-term potential of these customers. Many of them are not lost but temporarily distracted. \u201cA customer might transact for about 3,000 rupees every quarter,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s 12,000 rupees a year. If that person stops transacting, most brands put them back into the retargeting bucket.\u201dInstead of repeatedly spending on reacquisition, Jain suggests that marketers should focus on strengthening existing relationships. \u201cThat person can probably buy for 25 to 30 years,\u201d he says. \u201cYou are looking at a five to six lakh lifetime value, and if their attention goes elsewhere, you have to win it back.\u201dBy identifying early signs of disengagement and re-establishing communication before the customer drifts away, brands can preserve loyalty while cutting down on unnecessary ad spend. Jain says the agentic system is built to help marketers detect these moments and act immediately, ensuring retention efforts are proactive rather than reactive.Early numbers and the prerequisitesWhile Netcore is still expanding its agentic portfolio, Jain says early pilot data is encouraging. \u201cOur belief is, from the early numbers that we are seeing, we can actually show probably at 20, 25, up to a 40 per cent jump in contribution for the CRM channel,\u201d he notes.But such results depend on two key conditions: data unification and leadership alignment. \u201cYou can\u2019t have website data, app data and push data sitting in three different places,\u201d he explains. \u201cThey are the same customer.\u201dHe adds that the CEO\u2019s support is crucial. \u201cThe CEO has to think of marketing as a profit centre, not as a cost centre,\u201d Jain says. \u201cOtherwise, the data won\u2019t come together.\u201dHuman in the loopDespite the talk of autonomy, Jain is clear that the transition will not happen overnight. \u201cI don\u2019t think autonomy is going to happen right away,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat you will have is human in the loop, at least for the foreseeable future.\u201dHe compares the process to manufacturing quality checks. \u201cInstead of checking everything, you can do random sampling,\u201d he says. \u201cThe Insights Agent, for example, can tell a marketer in five minutes what used to take four hours; here are the best-performing campaigns, here\u2019s the action you need to take, and here\u2019s the creative ready for today\u2019s campaigns.\u201dThis, he believes, will redefine how marketing teams spend their time. \u201cPeople can move from routine execution to strategy and creativity,\u201d he says. \u201cThe agents can handle the heavy lifting.\u201dThe evolving role of the CMOJain believes that the rise of agentic AI will fundamentally reshape the role of the Chief Marketing Officer. In his view, the modern CMO can no longer rely solely on creativity and campaign execution; they must now understand data, technology and business metrics at a far deeper level.\u201cAgenting is a phenomenal opportunity for CMOs if they are willing to unlearn the past, be ambitious about the future and decide to learn new things,\u201d he says.He points out that marketing leaders will increasingly be measured not just by brand awareness or engagement, but by their ability to deliver profitable growth. This shift requires CMOs to think like business strategists, capable of connecting customer experience, data and profit outcomes in one unified framework.According to Jain, the most successful marketing leaders of the future will be those who can bridge creative intuition with analytical precision. \u201cIt requires unlearning and learning new things,\u201d he adds, \u201cand that is where the CMO will need the support of the CEO to make these shifts happen.\u201dHe emphasises that this transformation will also demand a mindset change within organisations. CMOs must champion data unification, encourage experimentation with AI-driven systems and establish marketing as a profit centre rather than a cost function. Those who adapt quickly, Jain suggests, will be best placed to harness agentic AI not just as a tool for automation, but as a driver of business intelligence and competitive advantage.", "country": ["india"], "category": ["business"], "pubDate": "2025-11-11 23:50:37", "source_id": "afaqs", "source_name": "Afaqs"}, "b766b15f43ae1a6a848e78ed86505190": {"link": "https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/video/dow-notches-record-high-close-235036522.html", "title": "Dow notches record high close, traders bet on end to shutdown", "description": "STORY: U.S stocks ended mixed on Tuesday, with the Dow gaining more than 1% to close at a record high, the S&P 500 adding two-tenths of a percent and the tech-heavy Nasdaq shedding a quarter of a percent.Optimism over an end to the record-long U.S. government shutdown fueled gains, but jitters about sky-high valuations of AI-related stocks weighed on the Nasdaq, says Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research.\"Tech stocks certainly have been quite volatile over the past week, and I think there are two reasons for that: valuations and concerns over monetization.

Tech stocks, however, have traded as much as a 73% premium to that 20-year average P/E ratio.

Roughly 70% of global internet traffic passes through its fiber backbone at some point, attracting hyperscalers such as Amazon Web Services, Google, Microsoft, and Meta, and making any remaining land zoned for massive data-center development among some of the most valuable real estate on Earth.Local media outlet Loudon Now has put a price tag on a 97-acre parcel east of Leesburg that sold earlier this month for a whopping $615 million, setting a new per-acre record in the county at over $6 million. The seller, JK Land Holdings, had purchased the Twin Creeks site for $57 million four years ago and secured approval for five two-story data centers. The buyer, an affiliate of SDC Capital Partners, recently acquired a separate portion of the property, previously sold to Dominion Energy for $45 million, to build a substation. JK Land Holdings manager Chuck Kuhn declined to comment about the transaction but noted, \"This transaction brought $4 million of transfer taxes alone into Loudoun County\u2014right this week.\"\"This one project alone will create between 150 and 200 full-time jobs in the county. It's going to create hundreds of construction jobs for years in the county. ... When you think about the construction workers utilizing hotel rooms, restaurants, gas stations, stores, etc., it's really going to be a financial shot in the arm to the county and the town,\" Kuhn said. Kuhn said that limited industrial-zoned parcels in the county and new zoning curbs are fueling record land values, and warned that Loudoun is \"getting to the end of data in the county as we know it.\"\"It's supply and demand. We're getting into very, very limited supply in the Northern Virginia area. You're seeing sizable transactions,\" he said. \"With the new zoning regulations, we're getting to the end of data in Loudoun County as we know it, and it's driving up values. And that's unfortunate to see. I don't think data is right everywhere, but areas away from residential, away from schools, away from parks, certainly areas zoned for heavy industrial and quarry operations can be perfect locations.\"Beyond driving up data center-zoned land values across the county, the AI infrastructure boom across the Mid-Atlantic has strained grids, sending electricity prices soaring. Years of misguided green energy policies by Democrats led to premature retirements of fossil-fuel plants, stripping grids of much-needed spare capacity. Instead of focusing on producing new stable power generation, Democrats went all-in on unreliable solar and wind.\"Price-Spikes & Blackouts\": America's Power Crisis Is Just Getting Started https://t.co/vb51PEwHnb\u2014 zerohedge (@zerohedge) August 13, 2025What's needed now is competent governance and common-sense energy policies after a decade of failed far-left climate crusades that produce nothing but a power bill inflation crisis.

This likely would not have happened if established law had been reviewed and applied prior to the execution of the warrants,\u201d the statement reads.Marion County\u2019s board of commissioners approved agreements Monday with Eric Meyer, the owner and editor of the Marion County Record, and Ruth Herbel, the Marion city councilor whose home was raided in tandem with the newspaper office, and two other journalists. The agreements coincide with consent judgments expected to be submitted in their federal cases against the county.The county was a secondary player in the raids, in Meyer\u2019s eyes, but the agreements could play a part in the paper\u2019s ongoing cases against the city.\u201cEverybody involved in this is 100% convinced we are going to go to trial with the city,\u201d Meyer said. \u201cThis will make that easier in some regard.\u201dThe county\u2019s agreements with Deb Gruver and Phyllis Zorn, local journalists whose lives were upended by the raids, are more akin to settlements and don\u2019t include admissions of regret.The county agreed to pay Meyer $1.5 million, Herbel $650,000, Zorn $600,000, and Gruver $250,000, according to copies of the agreements obtained by Kansas Reflector.Insurance covers most of those funds, but the county must pay Meyer $50,000.In another lawsuit against former Marion police chief Gideon Cody, who is also facing criminal charges, Gruver settled earlier this year for $235,000.According to Meyer, Zorn has retired from her position at the Marion County Record, effective immediately.Monday\u2019s deals settle the county\u2019s obligations within four federal lawsuits against the city of Marion and Marion County governments and officials in the wake of the raids. Five cases were consolidated into a single federal lawsuit, and the four agreements give the county and the sheriff\u2019s office immunity from any future legal action related to the Aug. 11, 2023, searches and seizures at the Marion County Record, Meyer\u2019s home and Herbel\u2019s home.The county agreed to make available Marion County Sheriff Jeff Soyez, Detective Aaron Christner, and Undersheriff Larry Starkey for official interviews, which could be used in other legal disputes. Previously, the cases were stalled, preventing interviews from taking place.Claims against the city of Marion, its police department and other officials, including former Mayor David Mayfield and former police chief Gideon Cody, are not involved in the agreements.Kansas Reflector is part of States Newsroom, a nonprofit news network supported by grants and a coalition of donors as a 501c(3) public charity.
