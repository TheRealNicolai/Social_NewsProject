He has reported extensively from key conflict zones, including the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, as well as the Rohingya crisis, and has significant on-the-ground experience in diplomacy and security.

After more than two years of bombardment, displacement, and hunger, Palestinians are clinging to this truce as a breath of relief. Yet, even as we celebrate a pause in the bloodshed, it is impossible to ignore how fragile and uncertain this so-called \u201cpeace deal\u201d really is.As someone who has watched the cycles of violence in Gaza repeat themselves for decades, I cannot help but see this truce as both a lifeline and a warning. It is a lifeline because it may allow the people of Gaza to begin rebuilding what little remains of their lives. But it is also a warning because, without justice and accountability, any ceasefire will crumble like those before it.This deal\u2014brokered with heavy involvement from Tu\u0308rkiye, Egypt, and the United States\u2014rests on unstable ground. The ink may still be drying, but Israeli violations have already begun, and the political divisions across the region are as sharp as ever. Gulf states remain hesitant to commit, and the power imbalance between occupier and occupied persists. Still, for Palestinians, this fragile ceasefire is vitally important.A peace built on sandLet us be honest: this agreement is as vulnerable as the broken walls of Gaza City. It promises peace but leaves the fundamental injustices untouched. The blockade remains in place. The occupation continues. The refugees\u2019 right of return is ignored. The reconstruction process is tied up in political preconditions that serve Israel\u2019s security interests far more than Palestinian survival.Under the so-called \u201cphased withdrawal,\u201d Israel retains heavy security control over much of Gaza. Hamas is expected to disarm, while Israel faces no comparable requirement. There are vague mentions of international oversight but no mechanism to hold Israel accountable when it violates the deal\u2014as it already has, repeatedly.Without guarantees for sovereignty, accountability, and freedom of movement, this truce stands on shifting sand. The absence of trust between the parties, the deep trauma among Gazans, and the economic collapse of the enclave make this peace extremely fragile. The moment Palestinians feel that nothing has changed, resentment will fester again.The biggest risk is that this deal becomes another \u201cpause before the next war.\u201d And if that happens, Gaza will be rebuilt only to be destroyed again.Why the Gulf states are reluctantThe reluctance of Gulf Arab states is striking. Despite their rhetorical support for the Palestinian cause, most have avoided deep engagement with the Gaza crisis beyond humanitarian pledges. Their caution is political, economic, and strategic.Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have invested heavily in ties with Israel and the United States. For them, throwing full support behind Gaza reconstruction could jeopardize these new relationships. They fear that billions spent on rebuilding could vanish with the next round of Israeli bombing\u2014an entirely reasonable fear, given history.Many Gulf leaders also insist that any post-war reconstruction must go through the Palestinian Authority (PA), not Hamas. But Israel opposes that, creating yet another stalemate. Meanwhile, their own domestic agendas\u2014economic diversification, social reforms, and regional realignments\u2014have shifted their priorities inward.For the Gulf, it is easier to issue statements about \u201cArab solidarity\u201d than to take bold action that could antagonize Tel Aviv or Washington. Their reluctance leaves Gaza\u2019s people in limbo: celebrated in speeches, forgotten in budgets.The roles of Tu\u0308rkiye, Egypt, and the United StatesTu\u0308rkiye, Egypt, and the US each played crucial roles in bringing this deal to the table\u2014but their motivations differ.Egypt, as Gaza\u2019s neighbor, remains the key mediator. Cairo hosted the talks, proposed phased reconstruction, and sought to balance humanitarian needs with regional stability. Egypt\u2019s role is pragmatic: it wants to prevent chaos on its border, maintain its diplomatic leverage, and ensure that no new wave of refugees floods into Sinai.Tu\u0308rkiye has taken a more vocal moral stance. Ankara consistently defended Palestinian rights in international forums and pushed for a deal that recognizes Palestinian suffering. While Tu\u0308rkiye\u2019s diplomatic leverage over Israel is limited, its role in rallying Muslim solidarity and shaping global opinion cannot be dismissed.The United States, meanwhile, remains the central power broker. Washington\u2019s fingerprints are all over this agreement, from security arrangements to reconstruction oversight. Without US pressure, Israel would likely never have accepted even this limited ceasefire. But Washington\u2019s approach still reflects its old biases: prioritizing \u201cstability\u201d over justice, \u201csecurity\u201d over sovereignty.This triangle of mediation\u2014Tu\u0308rkiye, Egypt, and the US\u2014may have delivered a ceasefire, but whether they can sustain it depends on political will. If any of them waver, the deal could collapse overnight.2\u110b\u1175\u11af(\u1112\u1167\u11ab\u110c\u1175\u1109\u1175\u1100\u1161\u11ab) \u1100\u1161\u110c\u1161\u110c\u1175\u1100\u116e \u1107\u116e\u11a8\u1107\u116e\u110b\u1174 \u110c\u1161\u1107\u1161\u11af\u1105\u1175\u110b\u1161 \u1102\u1161\u11ab\u1106\u1175\u11ab \u110f\u1162\u11b7\u1111\u1173\u110b\u1166\u1109\u1165 \u1111\u1161\u1100\u116c\u1103\u116c\u11ab \u1100\u1165\u11ab\u1106\u116e\u11af\u110b\u1166 \u110b\u1161\u11ac\u110b\u1161 \u110b\u1175\u11bb\u1102\u1173\u11ab \u1111\u1161\u11af\u1105\u1166\u1109\u1173\u1110\u1161\u110b\u1175\u11ab\u110b\u1175\u11ab.

Despite formal commitments, Israeli forces have continued incursions, arrests, and air surveillance over Gaza. Reconstruction materials are blocked at checkpoints. Aid convoys are delayed. The siege remains in effect, strangling the enclave\u2019s economy and testing its people\u2019s patience.The Israeli government has also publicly opposed any significant role for the Palestinian Authority in Gaza\u2019s future governance\u2014undermining even the US-backed plan. And inside Israel, far-right ministers are openly calling for continued \u201csecurity operations\u201d in Gaza, a euphemism for indefinite control.In short, Israel treats the ceasefire as a tactical pause, not a genuine step toward peace. The message to Palestinians is cruelly familiar: the bombs may stop for now, but the occupation continues.Fragile, yet vital for PalestiniansGiven all these flaws, why does this ceasefire still matter?Because for the people of Gaza, it is the only thin thread of hope left. After months of relentless bombardment that killed tens of thousands and displaced nearly everyone, even a fragile peace is a lifeline. It means hospitals can reopen. Children can sleep without the sound of drones overhead. Families can begin to look for missing loved ones.It is also a political window. For the first time in months, Palestinians have an opportunity\u2014however limited\u2014to shape discussions about their own future. A functioning truce allows for reconstruction, for dialogue about governance, and for rebuilding the institutions that Israel and war have shattered.This ceasefire, if protected, could become a bridge toward something more permanent. It could allow Palestinian civil society to regroup, and regional actors to reassert that the path to real peace must go through justice.But if the ceasefire collapses, the humanitarian catastrophe will deepen beyond imagination. Gaza cannot endure another full-scale assault. The world cannot stand by again and watch hospitals turned to rubble, children buried under debris, and international law mocked with impunity.What the world must doThe international community must not treat this ceasefire as an end, but as a beginning. It must ensure that aid reaches those in need, that the blockade is lifted, and that Israel is held accountable for any violations. Gulf states must move from rhetoric to responsibility\u2014putting real money, real pressure, and real diplomacy behind their words.Most importantly, Palestinians themselves must be placed at the center of any political solution. The world has long talked about Gaza, rarely with Gaza. That must change.For this ceasefire to mean anything, it must pave the way for ending the occupation, restoring sovereignty, and ensuring that no child in Gaza ever again grows up under the shadow of war.The bottom lineThis ceasefire is not peace\u2014it is a pause. It is fragile, imperfect, and one-sided in many ways. But it is also a desperately needed moment for survival and reflection.If it holds, Gaza might begin to heal. If it fails, the world will have once again failed the Palestinian people.As a journalist who has covered too many wars, I can only hope that this time, the world will not look away when Israel tests the limits of this truce.

(NYSE:OVV) (TSX:OVV) (\"Ovintiv\" or the \"Company\") and NuVista Energy Ltd. (\"NuVista\") (TSX:NVA) today announced that they have entered into a definitive agreement whereby Ovintiv will acquire all of the outstanding shares of NuVista in a cash and stock transaction that values NuVista at approximately $2.7 billion (C$3.8 billion). Included in the total transaction value is approximately $215 million (C$300 million) of NuVista net debt and 18.5 million shares of NuVista common stock which Ovintiv purchased in a previous transaction. The acquisition is expected to add approximately 930 net 10,000-foot equivalent well locations, and approximately 140,000 net acres (approximately 70% undeveloped) in the core of the oil-rich Alberta Montney. Full year 2026 production from the acquired assets is expected to average approximately 100 MBOE/d (approximately 25 thousand barrels per day (\"Mbbls/d\") of oil and condensate). The assets are directly adjacent to Ovintiv's current operations and include access to processing and downstream infrastructure with significant available capacity. The transaction has been unanimously approved by the Boards of Directors of both companies.Ovintiv currently owns approximately 9.6% of NuVista's outstanding shares purchased previously in a private transaction for C$16.00 per share. Under the terms of the agreement, Ovintiv will acquire all of the issued and outstanding common shares not otherwise owned by Ovintiv for C$18.00 per share. Total consideration will be made up of 50% cash and 50% Ovintiv common stock. This results in a blended total acquisition price for NuVista of approximately C$17.80 per share. Following the transaction, NuVista shareholders other than Ovintiv will own approximately 10.6% of the pro forma company.\"This transaction boosts our free cash flow per share by acquiring top decile rate of return assets in the heart of the Montney oil window at an attractive price,\" said Ovintiv President and CEO, Brendan McCracken. \"The NuVista assets were identified as part of an in-depth technical and commercial analysis to identify the highest value undeveloped oil resource in North America. The position is 70% undeveloped and is an exceptional fit with our existing acreage and infrastructure. The team at NuVista has done a tremendous job building these assets which have demonstrated top-tier well performance. We are excited to apply our industry-leading expertise to the combined position. In addition to the high-quality resource and fit with our legacy assets, NuVista has secured significant processing capacity, further unlocking optionality for future oil and condensate growth, paired with a downstream market access portfolio that provides valuable natural gas price diversification outside of the AECO market. This acquisition, combined with the inventory additions from our bolt-on acquisition work in the Permian is putting our investors into top tier resource at very attractive full cycle returns. It demonstrates the power of our durable returns strategy and further reinforces our increasingly distinctive and growing premium-return inventory life.\"The cash portion of the transaction is expected to be funded through a combination of the Company's cash on hand, borrowings under the Company's credit facility and/or proceeds from a term loan.To fund a portion of the cash proceeds for the transaction, the Company has temporarily paused its share buyback program for two quarters. Ovintiv's bolt-on acquisition activity has effectively been paused until the share buyback program has resumed. The Company's base dividend is expected to remain unchanged.Ovintiv also announced plans to launch a divestiture process for its Anadarko asset, which it expects to complete by year-end 2026. Divestiture proceeds are expected to be used for accelerated debt reduction.Once the Company has reduced Non- GAAP Net Debt to or below its long-term target of $4.0 billion, Ovintiv plans to update its capital allocation framework to direct a greater portion of its post-dividend Non-GAAP Free Cash Flow to shareholder returns.1) Premium return well locations defined as generating a greater than 35% internal rate of return at $55/bbl WTI oil and $2.75/MMBtu NYMEX natural gas prices.Transaction Overview:Immediately Accretive \u2013 The transaction is expected to be immediately and long-term accretive across key operational and financial metrics including Return on Capital Employed, Non-GAAP Cash Flow per Share, and Non-GAAP Free Cash Flow per Share.Increases Montney Scale \u2013 The transaction is expected to add approximately 620 premium return locations and approximately 310 upside locations. Ovintiv's core land position in the Montney is expected to increase to approximately 510 thousand net acres. The Company's pro forma 2026 full year Montney oil and condensate production is expected to average approximately 85 Mbbls/d.Significant Synergies \u2013 The transaction is expected to generate cost synergies of approximately $100 million annually, comprised primarily of capital savings, production cost savings and overhead cost reductions. Per well cost savings are estimated at approximately $1 million across the acquired assets, consistent with Ovintiv's current Montney well costs, resulting from streamlined facility design and faster cycle times.Increased Processing and Downstream Capacity \u2013 NuVista has secured approximately 600 MMcf/d of long-term raw inlet ...Full story available on Benzinga.com", "content": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS", "keywords": ["acquisitions", "tsx:nva", "utilities", "takeovers", "tsx:ovv", "ovv", "mergers", "press releases", "oil", "commodities"], "creator": ["PRNewswire"], "language": "english", "country": ["united states of america"], "category": ["business"], "pubDate": "2025-11-04 22:00:00", "pubDateTZ": "UTC", "image_url": null, "video_url": null, "source_id": "benzinga", "source_name": "Benzinga", "source_priority": 2050, "source_url": "https://www.benzinga.com", "source_icon": "https://n.bytvi.com/benzinga.png", "sentiment": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "sentiment_stats": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_tag": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_region": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_org": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_summary": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS", "duplicate": true}, "0bdd8a363e7b1bd810a09f11cd79d57c": {"article_id": "0bdd8a363e7b1bd810a09f11cd79d57c", "link": "https://www.thesun.ie/tv/16058594/celebrity-traitors-alan-carr-poached-bbc-secret-game-show/", "title": "Celebrity Traitors\u2019 \u2018hottest\u2019 star poached by BBC for top secret new celebrity game show", "description": "CELEBRITY Traitors star Alan Carr has filmed a top secret pilot episode for a new Beeb quiz show, we can reveal.

New polling shows a shocking level of support for political violence, even after the assassination of Charlie Kirk. A new poll shows roughly a quarter of voters believe political violence is justified with the highest percentage among younger voters.The poll shows that 55 percent of Americans expect political violence to increase with the highest percentage among Harris voters at 61 percent.Younger Americans are the most supportive of political violence. The poll shows that one in three Americans under 45 years old believes that political violence is justified.This tracks with other polling that shows that roughly thirty percent of both Democrats and Republicans felt that political violence might be necessary.The rise in support for political violence comes at a time when politicians are increasingly engaging in violent or rage rhetoric.DNC Chair Ken Martin just told MSNBC\u2019s \u201cThe Beat\u201d that \u201cwe may be nearing\u201d the moment when \u201celections don\u2019t matter and then the resistance looks completely different.\u201d Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called on people to \u201cforcefully rise up.\u201dHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., who pictures himself brandishing a baseball bat has previously called upon people to \u201cfight in the streets.\u201dCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom previously declared, \u201cI\u2019m going to punch these sons of bitches in the mouth.\u201dVirginia Democratic gubernatorial nominee Abigail Spanberger called upon her supporters to \u201cLet your rage fuel you.\u201d She then refused to withdraw her support for the Democratic candidate for Attorney General, Jay Jones, who once expressed his desire to kill his political opponents and his children.In his podcast with co-host Al Hunt, James Carville was again spewing unhinged hate. He returned to treating Trump and others as Nazis and their supporters as \u201ccollaborators.\u201d I previously criticized Carville for that analogy. He later attacked me.Doubling down, Carville declared\u201cYou know what we do with collaborators? I think these corporations, my fantasy dream is that this nightmare ends in 2029 and I think we ought to have radical things. I think they all ought to have their heads shaven, they should be put in orange pajamas and they should be marched down Pennsylvania Avenue and the public should be invited to spit on them.\u201dTo be sure that his menacing words were not lost, he then added \u201cThe universities, the corporations, the law firms, all of these collaborators should be shaved, pajamaed and spit on.\u201dThere was no later pushback by his co-host, Hunt, or anyone else associated with the podcast.Notably, going into today\u2019s election, Jay Jones was still leading in the polls despite saying that he wanted to kill political opponents and their children. Democratic voters were clearly not deterred by such rage rhetoric.

The 55-year-old actor was spotted smiling for selfies, casually dressed with dark sunglasses, before hopping on his bike \u2014 but there\u2019s more going on beneath the surface than just a sunny day in the Big Apple. Deborra-Lee Furness Plans to Tell Her Side of the Story The twist? Hugh\u2019s estranged wife, Australian actress Deborra-Lee Furness, is reportedly gearing up to publish a raw and revealing \u201cdivorce diary.\u201d After officially filing for divorce last month, ending their 27-year marriage, Deborra-Lee seems ready to share the emotional highs and heartbreaking lows of their split. Sources say she\u2019s been meticulously writing down every detail of this difficult journey, determined to have her voice heard. Once the divorce is legally final, she plans to explore publishing deals that will bring her story to the public. A Heartbreaking Public Statement Sparks Interest Deborra-Lee made headlines with a heartfelt public statement where she spoke openly about her \u201ctraumatic journey of betrayal.\u201d She expressed deep empathy for others going through similar pain and reflected on the spiritual strength that\u2019s helped her cope. Her words were thoughtful and introspective, highlighting the wisdom she\u2019s gained and emphasizing the importance of living with integrity and boundaries after such a profound life change. She closed with the idea that \u201cnone of this is personal,\u201d a message that resonated with many but also hinted at underlying tensions. Behind the Scenes, a Memoir Could Shake Things Up While Deborra-Lee is keeping a calm front publicly, insiders reveal she\u2019s preparing to reclaim her narrative through a brutally honest memoir. This book might dive into the intricacies of the split, including Hugh Jackman\u2019s new relationship with Broadway star Sutton Foster. A source close to Deborra-Lee told New Idea that she \u201cwon\u2019t be silenced\u201d and is committed to sharing her truth, which could include revealing details that fans have only speculated about until now. New Romance and Family Tensions Speaking of Sutton Foster, the 50-year-old Broadway star is reportedly feeling the strain as Hugh tries to bring her into the family fold. Hugh and Deborra-Lee share two adopted children, Oscar, 25, and Ava, 19, and sources say Hugh wants Sutton to bond with them \u2014 but Sutton is cautious about moving too fast. According to insiders, Sutton has asked Hugh to slow things down, especially with important family events like Oscar\u2019s recent birthday and Ava\u2019s upcoming one in July. She seems wary of rushing introductions while the divorce remains unsettled and the atmosphere around the family still feels tense. What Lies Ahead for This High-Profile Split? If Deborra-Lee\u2019s memoir comes to fruition, it will likely be one of the most talked-about celebrity books in recent years. With decades of Hollywood experiences, personal struggles, and a headline-making divorce to unpack, publishers are surely eager for the opportunity. Meanwhile, Hugh Jackman has stayed quiet publicly about the split but reportedly feels \u201cextremely disappointed\u201d by Deborra-Lee\u2019s comments.
