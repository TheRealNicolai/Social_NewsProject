He has reported extensively from key conflict zones, including the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, as well as the Rohingya crisis, and has significant on-the-ground experience in diplomacy and security.

After more than two years of bombardment, displacement, and hunger, Palestinians are clinging to this truce as a breath of relief. Yet, even as we celebrate a pause in the bloodshed, it is impossible to ignore how fragile and uncertain this so-called \u201cpeace deal\u201d really is.As someone who has watched the cycles of violence in Gaza repeat themselves for decades, I cannot help but see this truce as both a lifeline and a warning. It is a lifeline because it may allow the people of Gaza to begin rebuilding what little remains of their lives. But it is also a warning because, without justice and accountability, any ceasefire will crumble like those before it.This deal\u2014brokered with heavy involvement from Tu\u0308rkiye, Egypt, and the United States\u2014rests on unstable ground. The ink may still be drying, but Israeli violations have already begun, and the political divisions across the region are as sharp as ever. Gulf states remain hesitant to commit, and the power imbalance between occupier and occupied persists. Still, for Palestinians, this fragile ceasefire is vitally important.A peace built on sandLet us be honest: this agreement is as vulnerable as the broken walls of Gaza City. It promises peace but leaves the fundamental injustices untouched. The blockade remains in place. The occupation continues. The refugees\u2019 right of return is ignored. The reconstruction process is tied up in political preconditions that serve Israel\u2019s security interests far more than Palestinian survival.Under the so-called \u201cphased withdrawal,\u201d Israel retains heavy security control over much of Gaza. Hamas is expected to disarm, while Israel faces no comparable requirement. There are vague mentions of international oversight but no mechanism to hold Israel accountable when it violates the deal\u2014as it already has, repeatedly.Without guarantees for sovereignty, accountability, and freedom of movement, this truce stands on shifting sand. The absence of trust between the parties, the deep trauma among Gazans, and the economic collapse of the enclave make this peace extremely fragile. The moment Palestinians feel that nothing has changed, resentment will fester again.The biggest risk is that this deal becomes another \u201cpause before the next war.\u201d And if that happens, Gaza will be rebuilt only to be destroyed again.Why the Gulf states are reluctantThe reluctance of Gulf Arab states is striking. Despite their rhetorical support for the Palestinian cause, most have avoided deep engagement with the Gaza crisis beyond humanitarian pledges. Their caution is political, economic, and strategic.Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have invested heavily in ties with Israel and the United States. For them, throwing full support behind Gaza reconstruction could jeopardize these new relationships. They fear that billions spent on rebuilding could vanish with the next round of Israeli bombing\u2014an entirely reasonable fear, given history.Many Gulf leaders also insist that any post-war reconstruction must go through the Palestinian Authority (PA), not Hamas. But Israel opposes that, creating yet another stalemate. Meanwhile, their own domestic agendas\u2014economic diversification, social reforms, and regional realignments\u2014have shifted their priorities inward.For the Gulf, it is easier to issue statements about \u201cArab solidarity\u201d than to take bold action that could antagonize Tel Aviv or Washington. Their reluctance leaves Gaza\u2019s people in limbo: celebrated in speeches, forgotten in budgets.The roles of Tu\u0308rkiye, Egypt, and the United StatesTu\u0308rkiye, Egypt, and the US each played crucial roles in bringing this deal to the table\u2014but their motivations differ.Egypt, as Gaza\u2019s neighbor, remains the key mediator. Cairo hosted the talks, proposed phased reconstruction, and sought to balance humanitarian needs with regional stability. Egypt\u2019s role is pragmatic: it wants to prevent chaos on its border, maintain its diplomatic leverage, and ensure that no new wave of refugees floods into Sinai.Tu\u0308rkiye has taken a more vocal moral stance. Ankara consistently defended Palestinian rights in international forums and pushed for a deal that recognizes Palestinian suffering. While Tu\u0308rkiye\u2019s diplomatic leverage over Israel is limited, its role in rallying Muslim solidarity and shaping global opinion cannot be dismissed.The United States, meanwhile, remains the central power broker. Washington\u2019s fingerprints are all over this agreement, from security arrangements to reconstruction oversight. Without US pressure, Israel would likely never have accepted even this limited ceasefire. But Washington\u2019s approach still reflects its old biases: prioritizing \u201cstability\u201d over justice, \u201csecurity\u201d over sovereignty.This triangle of mediation\u2014Tu\u0308rkiye, Egypt, and the US\u2014may have delivered a ceasefire, but whether they can sustain it depends on political will. If any of them waver, the deal could collapse overnight.2\u110b\u1175\u11af(\u1112\u1167\u11ab\u110c\u1175\u1109\u1175\u1100\u1161\u11ab) \u1100\u1161\u110c\u1161\u110c\u1175\u1100\u116e \u1107\u116e\u11a8\u1107\u116e\u110b\u1174 \u110c\u1161\u1107\u1161\u11af\u1105\u1175\u110b\u1161 \u1102\u1161\u11ab\u1106\u1175\u11ab \u110f\u1162\u11b7\u1111\u1173\u110b\u1166\u1109\u1165 \u1111\u1161\u1100\u116c\u1103\u116c\u11ab \u1100\u1165\u11ab\u1106\u116e\u11af\u110b\u1166 \u110b\u1161\u11ac\u110b\u1161 \u110b\u1175\u11bb\u1102\u1173\u11ab \u1111\u1161\u11af\u1105\u1166\u1109\u1173\u1110\u1161\u110b\u1175\u11ab\u110b\u1175\u11ab.

Despite formal commitments, Israeli forces have continued incursions, arrests, and air surveillance over Gaza. Reconstruction materials are blocked at checkpoints. Aid convoys are delayed. The siege remains in effect, strangling the enclave\u2019s economy and testing its people\u2019s patience.The Israeli government has also publicly opposed any significant role for the Palestinian Authority in Gaza\u2019s future governance\u2014undermining even the US-backed plan. And inside Israel, far-right ministers are openly calling for continued \u201csecurity operations\u201d in Gaza, a euphemism for indefinite control.In short, Israel treats the ceasefire as a tactical pause, not a genuine step toward peace. The message to Palestinians is cruelly familiar: the bombs may stop for now, but the occupation continues.Fragile, yet vital for PalestiniansGiven all these flaws, why does this ceasefire still matter?Because for the people of Gaza, it is the only thin thread of hope left. After months of relentless bombardment that killed tens of thousands and displaced nearly everyone, even a fragile peace is a lifeline. It means hospitals can reopen. Children can sleep without the sound of drones overhead. Families can begin to look for missing loved ones.It is also a political window. For the first time in months, Palestinians have an opportunity\u2014however limited\u2014to shape discussions about their own future. A functioning truce allows for reconstruction, for dialogue about governance, and for rebuilding the institutions that Israel and war have shattered.This ceasefire, if protected, could become a bridge toward something more permanent. It could allow Palestinian civil society to regroup, and regional actors to reassert that the path to real peace must go through justice.But if the ceasefire collapses, the humanitarian catastrophe will deepen beyond imagination. Gaza cannot endure another full-scale assault. The world cannot stand by again and watch hospitals turned to rubble, children buried under debris, and international law mocked with impunity.What the world must doThe international community must not treat this ceasefire as an end, but as a beginning. It must ensure that aid reaches those in need, that the blockade is lifted, and that Israel is held accountable for any violations. Gulf states must move from rhetoric to responsibility\u2014putting real money, real pressure, and real diplomacy behind their words.Most importantly, Palestinians themselves must be placed at the center of any political solution. The world has long talked about Gaza, rarely with Gaza. That must change.For this ceasefire to mean anything, it must pave the way for ending the occupation, restoring sovereignty, and ensuring that no child in Gaza ever again grows up under the shadow of war.The bottom lineThis ceasefire is not peace\u2014it is a pause. It is fragile, imperfect, and one-sided in many ways. But it is also a desperately needed moment for survival and reflection.If it holds, Gaza might begin to heal. If it fails, the world will have once again failed the Palestinian people.As a journalist who has covered too many wars, I can only hope that this time, the world will not look away when Israel tests the limits of this truce.

(NYSE:OVV) (TSX:OVV) (\"Ovintiv\" or the \"Company\") and NuVista Energy Ltd. (\"NuVista\") (TSX:NVA) today announced that they have entered into a definitive agreement whereby Ovintiv will acquire all of the outstanding shares of NuVista in a cash and stock transaction that values NuVista at approximately $2.7 billion (C$3.8 billion). Included in the total transaction value is approximately $215 million (C$300 million) of NuVista net debt and 18.5 million shares of NuVista common stock which Ovintiv purchased in a previous transaction. The acquisition is expected to add approximately 930 net 10,000-foot equivalent well locations, and approximately 140,000 net acres (approximately 70% undeveloped) in the core of the oil-rich Alberta Montney. Full year 2026 production from the acquired assets is expected to average approximately 100 MBOE/d (approximately 25 thousand barrels per day (\"Mbbls/d\") of oil and condensate). The assets are directly adjacent to Ovintiv's current operations and include access to processing and downstream infrastructure with significant available capacity. The transaction has been unanimously approved by the Boards of Directors of both companies.Ovintiv currently owns approximately 9.6% of NuVista's outstanding shares purchased previously in a private transaction for C$16.00 per share. Under the terms of the agreement, Ovintiv will acquire all of the issued and outstanding common shares not otherwise owned by Ovintiv for C$18.00 per share. Total consideration will be made up of 50% cash and 50% Ovintiv common stock. This results in a blended total acquisition price for NuVista of approximately C$17.80 per share. Following the transaction, NuVista shareholders other than Ovintiv will own approximately 10.6% of the pro forma company.\"This transaction boosts our free cash flow per share by acquiring top decile rate of return assets in the heart of the Montney oil window at an attractive price,\" said Ovintiv President and CEO, Brendan McCracken. \"The NuVista assets were identified as part of an in-depth technical and commercial analysis to identify the highest value undeveloped oil resource in North America. The position is 70% undeveloped and is an exceptional fit with our existing acreage and infrastructure. The team at NuVista has done a tremendous job building these assets which have demonstrated top-tier well performance. We are excited to apply our industry-leading expertise to the combined position. In addition to the high-quality resource and fit with our legacy assets, NuVista has secured significant processing capacity, further unlocking optionality for future oil and condensate growth, paired with a downstream market access portfolio that provides valuable natural gas price diversification outside of the AECO market. This acquisition, combined with the inventory additions from our bolt-on acquisition work in the Permian is putting our investors into top tier resource at very attractive full cycle returns. It demonstrates the power of our durable returns strategy and further reinforces our increasingly distinctive and growing premium-return inventory life.\"The cash portion of the transaction is expected to be funded through a combination of the Company's cash on hand, borrowings under the Company's credit facility and/or proceeds from a term loan.To fund a portion of the cash proceeds for the transaction, the Company has temporarily paused its share buyback program for two quarters. Ovintiv's bolt-on acquisition activity has effectively been paused until the share buyback program has resumed. The Company's base dividend is expected to remain unchanged.Ovintiv also announced plans to launch a divestiture process for its Anadarko asset, which it expects to complete by year-end 2026. Divestiture proceeds are expected to be used for accelerated debt reduction.Once the Company has reduced Non- GAAP Net Debt to or below its long-term target of $4.0 billion, Ovintiv plans to update its capital allocation framework to direct a greater portion of its post-dividend Non-GAAP Free Cash Flow to shareholder returns.1) Premium return well locations defined as generating a greater than 35% internal rate of return at $55/bbl WTI oil and $2.75/MMBtu NYMEX natural gas prices.Transaction Overview:Immediately Accretive \u2013 The transaction is expected to be immediately and long-term accretive across key operational and financial metrics including Return on Capital Employed, Non-GAAP Cash Flow per Share, and Non-GAAP Free Cash Flow per Share.Increases Montney Scale \u2013 The transaction is expected to add approximately 620 premium return locations and approximately 310 upside locations. Ovintiv's core land position in the Montney is expected to increase to approximately 510 thousand net acres. The Company's pro forma 2026 full year Montney oil and condensate production is expected to average approximately 85 Mbbls/d.Significant Synergies \u2013 The transaction is expected to generate cost synergies of approximately $100 million annually, comprised primarily of capital savings, production cost savings and overhead cost reductions. Per well cost savings are estimated at approximately $1 million across the acquired assets, consistent with Ovintiv's current Montney well costs, resulting from streamlined facility design and faster cycle times.Increased Processing and Downstream Capacity \u2013 NuVista has secured approximately 600 MMcf/d of long-term raw inlet ...Full story available on Benzinga.com", "content": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS", "keywords": ["acquisitions", "tsx:nva", "utilities", "takeovers", "tsx:ovv", "ovv", "mergers", "press releases", "oil", "commodities"], "creator": ["PRNewswire"], "language": "english", "country": ["united states of america"], "category": ["business"], "pubDate": "2025-11-04 22:00:00", "pubDateTZ": "UTC", "image_url": null, "video_url": null, "source_id": "benzinga", "source_name": "Benzinga", "source_priority": 2050, "source_url": "https://www.benzinga.com", "source_icon": "https://n.bytvi.com/benzinga.png", "sentiment": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "sentiment_stats": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_tag": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_region": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_org": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_summary": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS", "duplicate": true}, "0bdd8a363e7b1bd810a09f11cd79d57c": {"article_id": "0bdd8a363e7b1bd810a09f11cd79d57c", "link": "https://www.thesun.ie/tv/16058594/celebrity-traitors-alan-carr-poached-bbc-secret-game-show/", "title": "Celebrity Traitors\u2019 \u2018hottest\u2019 star poached by BBC for top secret new celebrity game show", "description": "CELEBRITY Traitors star Alan Carr has filmed a top secret pilot episode for a new Beeb quiz show, we can reveal.

New polling shows a shocking level of support for political violence, even after the assassination of Charlie Kirk. A new poll shows roughly a quarter of voters believe political violence is justified with the highest percentage among younger voters.The poll shows that 55 percent of Americans expect political violence to increase with the highest percentage among Harris voters at 61 percent.Younger Americans are the most supportive of political violence. The poll shows that one in three Americans under 45 years old believes that political violence is justified.This tracks with other polling that shows that roughly thirty percent of both Democrats and Republicans felt that political violence might be necessary.The rise in support for political violence comes at a time when politicians are increasingly engaging in violent or rage rhetoric.DNC Chair Ken Martin just told MSNBC\u2019s \u201cThe Beat\u201d that \u201cwe may be nearing\u201d the moment when \u201celections don\u2019t matter and then the resistance looks completely different.\u201d Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called on people to \u201cforcefully rise up.\u201dHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., who pictures himself brandishing a baseball bat has previously called upon people to \u201cfight in the streets.\u201dCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom previously declared, \u201cI\u2019m going to punch these sons of bitches in the mouth.\u201dVirginia Democratic gubernatorial nominee Abigail Spanberger called upon her supporters to \u201cLet your rage fuel you.\u201d She then refused to withdraw her support for the Democratic candidate for Attorney General, Jay Jones, who once expressed his desire to kill his political opponents and his children.In his podcast with co-host Al Hunt, James Carville was again spewing unhinged hate. He returned to treating Trump and others as Nazis and their supporters as \u201ccollaborators.\u201d I previously criticized Carville for that analogy. He later attacked me.Doubling down, Carville declared\u201cYou know what we do with collaborators? I think these corporations, my fantasy dream is that this nightmare ends in 2029 and I think we ought to have radical things. I think they all ought to have their heads shaven, they should be put in orange pajamas and they should be marched down Pennsylvania Avenue and the public should be invited to spit on them.\u201dTo be sure that his menacing words were not lost, he then added \u201cThe universities, the corporations, the law firms, all of these collaborators should be shaved, pajamaed and spit on.\u201dThere was no later pushback by his co-host, Hunt, or anyone else associated with the podcast.Notably, going into today\u2019s election, Jay Jones was still leading in the polls despite saying that he wanted to kill political opponents and their children. Democratic voters were clearly not deterred by such rage rhetoric.

The 55-year-old actor was spotted smiling for selfies, casually dressed with dark sunglasses, before hopping on his bike \u2014 but there\u2019s more going on beneath the surface than just a sunny day in the Big Apple. Deborra-Lee Furness Plans to Tell Her Side of the Story The twist? Hugh\u2019s estranged wife, Australian actress Deborra-Lee Furness, is reportedly gearing up to publish a raw and revealing \u201cdivorce diary.\u201d After officially filing for divorce last month, ending their 27-year marriage, Deborra-Lee seems ready to share the emotional highs and heartbreaking lows of their split. Sources say she\u2019s been meticulously writing down every detail of this difficult journey, determined to have her voice heard. Once the divorce is legally final, she plans to explore publishing deals that will bring her story to the public. A Heartbreaking Public Statement Sparks Interest Deborra-Lee made headlines with a heartfelt public statement where she spoke openly about her \u201ctraumatic journey of betrayal.\u201d She expressed deep empathy for others going through similar pain and reflected on the spiritual strength that\u2019s helped her cope. Her words were thoughtful and introspective, highlighting the wisdom she\u2019s gained and emphasizing the importance of living with integrity and boundaries after such a profound life change. She closed with the idea that \u201cnone of this is personal,\u201d a message that resonated with many but also hinted at underlying tensions. Behind the Scenes, a Memoir Could Shake Things Up While Deborra-Lee is keeping a calm front publicly, insiders reveal she\u2019s preparing to reclaim her narrative through a brutally honest memoir. This book might dive into the intricacies of the split, including Hugh Jackman\u2019s new relationship with Broadway star Sutton Foster. A source close to Deborra-Lee told New Idea that she \u201cwon\u2019t be silenced\u201d and is committed to sharing her truth, which could include revealing details that fans have only speculated about until now. New Romance and Family Tensions Speaking of Sutton Foster, the 50-year-old Broadway star is reportedly feeling the strain as Hugh tries to bring her into the family fold. Hugh and Deborra-Lee share two adopted children, Oscar, 25, and Ava, 19, and sources say Hugh wants Sutton to bond with them \u2014 but Sutton is cautious about moving too fast. According to insiders, Sutton has asked Hugh to slow things down, especially with important family events like Oscar\u2019s recent birthday and Ava\u2019s upcoming one in July. She seems wary of rushing introductions while the divorce remains unsettled and the atmosphere around the family still feels tense. What Lies Ahead for This High-Profile Split? If Deborra-Lee\u2019s memoir comes to fruition, it will likely be one of the most talked-about celebrity books in recent years. With decades of Hollywood experiences, personal struggles, and a headline-making divorce to unpack, publishers are surely eager for the opportunity. Meanwhile, Hugh Jackman has stayed quiet publicly about the split but reportedly feels \u201cextremely disappointed\u201d by Deborra-Lee\u2019s comments.

WIRED reported Tuesday that last month, the FBI acknowledged that when U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement cannot be identified and confirmed as legitimate, it gives license to people to pose as officers and nab people. Such was the case when a man claiming to be a sworn officer marched into a Raleigh, North Carolina, motel room and threatened to deport the woman if she did not have sex with him.In a Bay County, Florida case, a woman unzipped her jacket to show an ICE t-shirt and ordered her ex-boyfriend's wife to come with her. The woman grabbed her and took her to an apartment complex before the victim was finally able to escape. In a New York case, a man claimed he was an immigration officer and \"directed [her] to a nearby stairwell,\" WIRED reported. He then punched her, tried to rape her, and took her cell phone. The police ultimately caught him. In other cases, it's unknown if the attackers were, in fact, ICE agents taking advantage of their position or individuals posing as ICE agents. WIRED said that the FBI's notice encouraged agencies to have their officers \"clearly identify themselves and to cooperate when civilians ask to verify an officer\u2019s identity\u2014including by allowing calls to a local police precinct.\"\u201cEnsure law enforcement personnel adequality [sic] identify themselves during operations and cooperate with individuals who request further verification,\u201d the bulletin said.Federal laws mandate that immigration officers identify themselves and state the reason for an arrest. But in video after video of ICE agents grabbing people in Chicago, Portland and Washington, D.C. agents consistently refuse to identify themselves when bystanders request information. In one Chicago case, ICE pepper-sprayed a crowd of people filming them. One officer also pointed a gun at a woman who had her camera phone turned to him. \u201cThe recent increased presence of armed, masked federal officers completely disrupts and erodes public trust in law enforcement,\u201d Alycia Castillo of the Texas Civil Rights Project told WIRED. \u201cFurther, the increase in local cooperation with federal authorities through 287(g) agreements has led to a chilling effect on local law enforcement for communities.\"The 287(g) program \"deputizes local police to act as immigration agents,\" said WIRED. In Chicago, ICE and other federal agents are in unmarked vehicles, and videos show that while many wear clothing that identifies their agency, some do not.", "content": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS", "keywords": null, "creator": ["Sarah K.

Similarly, Tom Cruise\u2019s 2017 attempt at a reboot similarly fell flat. Fraser returns to The Mummy during a career renaissance buoyed by his Oscar for his performance in the 2022 movie, The Whale. He previously said he\u2019d be open to returning to The Mummy franchise \u201cif someone came up with the right conceit.\u201d Weisz has remained active in Hollywood, winning awards and nominations for 2019\u2019s The Favorite.Read it at VarietyRead more at The Daily Beast.", "content": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS", "keywords": ["story"], "creator": ["Adam Downer"], "language": "english", "country": ["united states of america"], "category": ["entertainment", "top"], "pubDate": "2025-11-04 21:57:11", "pubDateTZ": "UTC", "image_url": "https://thedailybeast-thedailybeast-prod.web.arc-cdn.net/resizer/v2//TOA46Y2JEZA4TN5HR67HJQNTWU.jpg?auth=7a52216b21f5e9d7c02bae41c6462d50949b03bad14efba3c05a5002fa237f3c&height=1440&smart=true&width=2560", "video_url": null, "source_id": "thedailybeast", "source_name": "The Daily Beast", "source_priority": 1258, "source_url": "https://www.thedailybeast.com", "source_icon": "https://n.bytvi.com/thedailybeast.png", "sentiment": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "sentiment_stats": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_tag": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_region": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_org": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_summary": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS", "duplicate": false}, "599c800bf12e9b66b0c331c722a48d5b": {"article_id": "599c800bf12e9b66b0c331c722a48d5b", "link": "https://biztoc.com/x/08b776c0dc0dea95", "title": "Upstart Stock Slides After Mixed Q3 Results: Details", "description": "Upstart Holdings, Inc.

Please see the reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and additional information about the non-GAAP financial measures set forth in tables attached to this press release.Natalia Shuman, President and Chief Executive Officer commented:\"I am pleased to report our third quarter performance, which resulted in quarterly Adjusted EBITDA of $30.2 million, up nearly 30% year-over-year, reflecting continued material improvement in our operating leverage and pursuit of profitable growth and diversification. We believe that this growth reflects the strength of our operating model, disciplined cost management, and continued focus on driving efficiencies across the business. We also achieved an increase in revenue of 7.0%, with growth generated in each of our five largest industries served, including double-digit growth in Aerospace & Defense, Industrials, Infrastructure, and Power Generation. This overall revenue growth was driven by market demand for our services and demonstrates the success of our comprehensive solutions and our ability to deliver on our customers' expectations.\"Ms. Shuman continued, \"We have the foundation, technical know-how, proven expertise and the people to win. We are advancing our organizational systems, empowering our technicians with digital tools, and investing in relationships with our customers to drive ROI and shareholder value.\"Third Quarter and First Nine Months 2025 Additional Detailed Highlights:The Company's prior year results reflect the reclassification of certain overhead and personnel expenses in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income, from SG&A to cost of revenue. The reclassification recorded within the financials was $5.7 million and $15.4 million for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024, respectively. This reclassification of overhead and personnel expenses had no impact on income from operations, net income or Adjusted EBITDA comparability. Income from operations was $20.4 million in the third quarter of 2025, as compared to $11.9 million in the prior year comparable period, an increase of 71.9% year over year. Third quarter income from operations before special items (non-GAAP) was $22.3 million as compared to $13.1 million in the prior year comparable period.The Company recorded $1.8 million of reorganization and other costs in the third quarter of 2025 related to the Company's continued actions to reduce support, overhead, and other related costs.Net income was $13.1 million in the third quarter of 2025, or $0.41 per diluted share, as compared to net income of $6.4 million, or $0.20 per diluted share, in the prior year comparable period. Third quarter net income excluding special items (non-GAAP) was $14.6 million, or $0.46 per diluted share, as compared to net income excluding special items (non-GAAP) of $6.3 million, or $0.20 per diluted share, in the prior year comparable period.In the first nine months of 2025, net cash provided by operating activities was $0.8 million, a decrease from $24.5 million of net cash provided by operating activities in the prior year period. Free cash flow (non-GAAP) was negative $20.9 million in the first nine months of 2025, compared to positive $6.3 million in the prior year comparable period. This decrease in net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow (non-GAAP) is largely due to an increase in accounts receivable related to working capital timing.The Company's gross debt was $202.3 million as of September 30, 2025, compared to $169.6 million and $189.4 million as of December 31, 2024 and June 30, 2025, respectively. The Company's net debt, a non-GAAP financial measure, was $174.5 million as of September 30, 2025 as compared to $151.3 million and $168.8 million as of December 31, 2024 and June 30, 2025, respectively.2025 Outlook Although strong revenue growth was achieved in the third quarter, the Company expects full-year 2025 revenue to be between $716.0 million to $720.0 million. This would represent essentially flat performance compared to the prior year, giving effect to the exclusion of voluntary Laboratory consolidations of approximately 1% in full year 2025 revenue resulting from the Company's ongoing efforts to exit unprofitable business during 2025.Adjusted EBITDA has continued to improve and is expected to increase for full-year 2025. Accordingly, the Company is raising its prior qualitative Adjusted EBITDA guidance range of exceeding the 2024 Adjusted EBITDA level of $82.5 million. Based on the strong third quarter performance and the current fourth quarter forecast, the Company now expects its full-year Adjusted EBITDA to be between $86.0 million to $88.0 million.Conference Call In connection with this release, MISTRAS will hold a conference call on November 5, 2025, at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Standard Time.

INVESTORS CONTACT:Edward PrajznerSenior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer+1 (833) MISTRAS | investors@mistrasgroup.com Forward-Looking and Cautionary StatementsCertain statements contained in this press release are \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, enhancements in our organizational systems, tools and integrated solutions, the Company's efforts to voluntarily exit unprofitable business and our outlook and expectations for full-year 2025 revenue and Adjusted EBITDA. Such forward-looking statements relate to MISTRAS' financial results and estimates, products and services, business model, operational and strategic initiatives to improve operating leverage, strategy, growth opportunities, profitability and competitive position, and other matters. These forward-looking statements generally use words such as \"future,\" \"possible,\" \"potential,\" \"targeted,\" \"anticipate,\" \"believe,\" \"estimate,\" \"expect,\" \"intend,\" \"plan,\" \"predict,\" \"project,\" \"will,\" \"may,\" \"should,\" \"could,\" \"would\" and other similar words and phrases. Such statements are not guarantees of future performance or results and will not necessarily be accurate indications of the times at, or by which, such performance or results will be achieved, if at all. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual performance or results to differ materially from those expressed in these statements. A list, description and discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties can be found in the \"Risk Factors\" section of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024 filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on March 11, 2025, as updated by our reports on Form 10-Q and Form 8-K. The forward-looking statements are made as of the date hereof, and MISTRAS undertakes no obligation to update such statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.Use of Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresIn addition to financial information prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (\"GAAP\"), this press release also contains adjusted financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and that we believe provide investors and management with supplemental information relating to the Company's operating performance and trends that facilitate comparisons between periods and with respect to trends and projected information. The term \"Adjusted EBITDA\" used in this release is a financial measure not calculated in accordance with GAAP and is defined by the Company as net income attributable to MISTRAS Group, Inc. plus: interest expense, provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation expense, certain acquisition related costs (including transaction due diligence costs and adjustments to the fair value of contingent consideration), foreign exchange (gain) loss, other income, non-cash impairment charges, reorganization and other costs and, if applicable, certain additional special items which are noted. A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to Net Income (Loss) as computed under GAAP is set forth in a table attached to this press release. The Company also uses the term \"free cash flow\" a non-GAAP financial measure. The Company defines \"free cash flow\" as cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures (which is classified as an investing activity). The Company additionally uses the terms: \"Segment and Total Company Income (Loss) from Operations (GAAP) to Income (Loss) from Operations before Special Items (non-GAAP)\", \"Net Income (Loss) (GAAP) and Diluted EPS (GAAP) to Net Income Excluding Special Items (non-GAAP) and Diluted EPS Excluding Special Items (non-GAAP)\" which reconciles the non-GAAP amounts to the GAAP financial measure. The non-GAAP financial performance measure \"Income (loss) from operations before special items\" is used for each of our three operating segments, the Corporate segment and the \"Total Company\". Income (Loss) from operations before Special Items excludes: (a) transaction expenses related to acquisitions, such as professional fees and due diligence costs, (b) the net changes in the fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration liabilities, (c) impairment charges, (d) reorganization and other costs, which includes items such as severance, labor relations matters and asset and lease termination costs and (e) other special items such as environmental expense and legal settlement and insurance recoveries. These adjustments have been excluded from the GAAP measure because these expenses and credits are not related to our or any individual segment's core business operations. The acquisition related costs and special items can be a net expense or credit in any given period. This press release also includes the term \"net debt\", a non-GAAP financial measure which the Company defines as the sum of the current and long-term portions of long-term debt, less cash and cash equivalents. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are also set forth in tables attached to this press release. Each of these non-GAAP financial measures has material limitations as a performance or liquidity measure and should not be considered alternatives to Net Income (Loss) or any other measures derived in accordance with GAAP. Because Income (loss) from operations before special items and other non-GAAP financial measures used in this press release may not be calculated in the same manner by all companies, these measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies.Mistras Group, Inc. and SubsidiariesUnaudited Summary Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets(in thousands) September 30,

The pilot was relaunched in 2018 at two locations.\u201cFor the pilot, a video conflict analysis was completed in partnership with UBC. The study showed LPIs have resulted in up to 20 per cent reduction in total conflicts between pedestrians and vehicles and up to 60 per cent reduction in high-severity conflicts between pedestrians and vehicles,\u201d a statement from the City said.Due to positive results from the pilot, the City decided to keep the pilot locations and formalize the program.\u201cCurrently, we complete 30 locations per year. To date, we have installed a total of 98 LPIs,\u201d the City added.According to the City of Vancouver, the LPIs allow pedestrians a three to seven-second head start. Other cities that have seen successful results from LPIs include Surrey and New York.Daily Hive Urbanized shared a little bit about some of the changes relating to LPIs in a story last year.LPIs allow pedestrians to enter the crosswalk a few seconds before vehicles are given a green light, which improves their visibility before vehicles have priority to turn right or left.An approved motion specifically directs City staff to increase the number of pedestrian traffic signals, rapid flashing beacons, and zebra markings and double or triple the number of LPI crossings in the 2023-2026 capital plan. It also explores restricting right turns on red lights at LPI-enabled intersections.Have you noticed the change in any other Vancouver neighbourhoods recently?

November brings another Old Age Security payment for taxpayers across the province, and this month's deposit reflects the most recent rate adjustment linked to inflation.OAS payments are managed by Service Canada and provide monthly financial support to Canadians aged 65 and older. These deposits typically arrive during the final week of each month and form a key part of retirement income for millions of seniors.The latest quarterly adjustment took effect in October, which increased OAS amounts to help offset rising living costs. November's payment will reflect those higher rates for the second month in a row.Whether you're already receiving OAS or nearing eligibility, here's what Quebec seniors need to know about November's payment amounts, eligibility, and how the program works.What is Old Age Security?Old Age Security is Canada's main federal pension program for seniors. It pays monthly benefits to eligible residents aged 65 and up, regardless of employment history or past contributions. OAS is separate from the Canada Pension Plan.Most seniors are automatically enrolled, with Service Canada sending a confirmation letter shortly before payments begin.The OAS program also includes additional support for low-income seniors, which may be added on top of the base pension for those who qualify.Who can receive Old Age Security?To qualify for OAS payments, you must:\u2022 Be 65 or older \u2022 Be a Canadian citizen or legal resident at the time your application is approved \u2022 Have lived in Canada for at least 10 years after turning 18If you live outside Canada now, you can still receive OAS if you lived in the country for at least 20 years after turning 18 and were a citizen or legal resident when you left.High-income seniors may have part of their OAS reduced through the OAS recovery tax. For 2025, the clawback begins if your annual income is above $148,541 for those aged 65 to 74, or $154,196 for seniors 75 and older.More about OAS eligibilityHow to apply for OAS paymentsMany Canadians are enrolled in OAS automatically, but not everyone. Most people receive a letter from Service Canada around age 64 that confirms when their payments will begin and outlines their options. If you get this letter, you usually do not need to apply.If you are not enrolled automatically, you will have to submit an application. Payments can begin the month after you turn 65, but you can choose to delay receiving OAS until as late as age 70. Waiting increases the monthly amount for life, since each month of deferral raises your eventual payment.Those who may qualify for linked programs, such as the Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) or other allowances, should know that some of these require a separate application.You can apply for OAS in one of the following ways:\u2022 Online: Through your My Service Canada Account. Have your documents and personal information ready before starting.\u2022 By mail or in person: Fill out the forms for OAS and submit them with the required documents to Service Canada by mail or at a Service Canada office.More about applying for OASHow much is the OAS payment for November?OAS payments are reviewed every January, April, July, and October to help keep pace with inflation. Rates increased by 0.7% this fall.Here are the current maximum monthly OAS amounts:\u2022 Ages 65 to 74: $740.05 \u2022 Ages 75 and over: $814.52These are the maximum amounts. What you receive depends on how long you have lived in Canada. You need 40 years of Canadian residence after age 18 to receive the full amount.More about OAS payment amountsIs OAS taxable?Yes. Old Age Security counts as taxable income in Canada and must be reported at tax time. Service Canada does not automatically withhold taxes, so seniors can request voluntary tax deductions if they prefer smaller tax bills in April.More about OAS and your taxesWhen is the November OAS payment arriving?The next OAS payment will be deposited on Wednesday, November 26, 2025.If you are signed up for direct deposit, it should land in your bank account that day. Cheques may take longer to arrive, and seniors are encouraged to switch to direct deposit to avoid delivery delays.Following November, the final OAS payment of the year will arrive on Monday, December 22, 2025.More about OAS payment dates", "content": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS", "keywords": ["government of canada benefits", "government payments", "old age security"], "creator": ["Montreal Staff"], "language": "english", "country": ["canada"], "category": ["business"], "pubDate": "2025-11-04 21:50:46", "pubDateTZ": "UTC", "image_url": "https://www.mtlblog.com/media-library/a-hand-holding-canadian-money.jpg?id=59803048&width=980", "video_url": null, "source_id": "mtlblog", "source_name": "Mtl Blog", "source_priority": 989494, "source_url": "https://www.mtlblog.com", "source_icon": "https://n.bytvi.com/mtlblog.png", "sentiment": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "sentiment_stats": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_tag": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_region": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_org": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS", "ai_summary": "ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS", "duplicate": false}, "2bc406a2a06d9470b57aa8251d937907": {"article_id": "2bc406a2a06d9470b57aa8251d937907", "link": "https://www.themarketsdaily.com/2025/11/04/clearway-energy-nysecwen-announces-earnings-results.html", "title": "Clearway Energy (NYSE:CWEN) Announces Earnings Results", "description": "Clearway Energy (NYSE:CWEN \u2013 Get Free Report) issued its quarterly earnings results on Tuesday.
