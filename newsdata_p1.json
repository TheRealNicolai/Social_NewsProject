Currently, he leads a team of over 100 journalists and oversees the editorial planning and publishing of international news. c\u110e\u1165\u11ab\u110c\u1175\u110b\u1175\u11af\u1107\u1169.The latest ceasefire in Gaza has brought a faint flicker of hope to a people who have lived through unimaginable devastation. After more than two years of bombardment, displacement, and hunger, Palestinians are clinging to this truce as a breath of relief. Yet, even as we celebrate a pause in the bloodshed, it is impossible to ignore how fragile and uncertain this so-called \u201cpeace deal\u201d really is.As someone who has watched the cycles of violence in Gaza repeat themselves for decades, I cannot help but see this truce as both a lifeline and a warning. It is a lifeline because it may allow the people of Gaza to begin rebuilding what little remains of their lives. But it is also a warning because, without justice and accountability, any ceasefire will crumble like those before it.This deal\u2014brokered with heavy involvement from Tu\u0308rkiye, Egypt, and the United States\u2014rests on unstable ground. The ink may still be drying, but Israeli violations have already begun, and the political divisions across the region are as sharp as ever. Gulf states remain hesitant to commit, and the power imbalance between occupier and occupied persists. Still, for Palestinians, this fragile ceasefire is vitally important.A peace built on sandLet us be honest: this agreement is as vulnerable as the broken walls of Gaza City. It promises peace but leaves the fundamental injustices untouched. The blockade remains in place. The occupation continues. The refugees\u2019 right of return is ignored. The reconstruction process is tied up in political preconditions that serve Israel\u2019s security interests far more than Palestinian survival.Under the so-called \u201cphased withdrawal,\u201d Israel retains heavy security control over much of Gaza. Hamas is expected to disarm, while Israel faces no comparable requirement. There are vague mentions of international oversight but no mechanism to hold Israel accountable when it violates the deal\u2014as it already has, repeatedly.Without guarantees for sovereignty, accountability, and freedom of movement, this truce stands on shifting sand. The absence of trust between the parties, the deep trauma among Gazans, and the economic collapse of the enclave make this peace extremely fragile. The moment Palestinians feel that nothing has changed, resentment will fester again.The biggest risk is that this deal becomes another \u201cpause before the next war.\u201d And if that happens, Gaza will be rebuilt only to be destroyed again.Why the Gulf states are reluctantThe reluctance of Gulf Arab states is striking. Despite their rhetorical support for the Palestinian cause, most have avoided deep engagement with the Gaza crisis beyond humanitarian pledges. Their caution is political, economic, and strategic.Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have invested heavily in ties with Israel and the United States. For them, throwing full support behind Gaza reconstruction could jeopardize these new relationships. They fear that billions spent on rebuilding could vanish with the next round of Israeli bombing\u2014an entirely reasonable fear, given history.Many Gulf leaders also insist that any post-war reconstruction must go through the Palestinian Authority (PA), not Hamas. But Israel opposes that, creating yet another stalemate. Meanwhile, their own domestic agendas\u2014economic diversification, social reforms, and regional realignments\u2014have shifted their priorities inward.For the Gulf, it is easier to issue statements about \u201cArab solidarity\u201d than to take bold action that could antagonize Tel Aviv or Washington. Their reluctance leaves Gaza\u2019s people in limbo: celebrated in speeches, forgotten in budgets.The roles of Tu\u0308rkiye, Egypt, and the United StatesTu\u0308rkiye, Egypt, and the US each played crucial roles in bringing this deal to the table\u2014but their motivations differ.Egypt, as Gaza\u2019s neighbor, remains the key mediator. Cairo hosted the talks, proposed phased reconstruction, and sought to balance humanitarian needs with regional stability. Egypt\u2019s role is pragmatic: it wants to prevent chaos on its border, maintain its diplomatic leverage, and ensure that no new wave of refugees floods into Sinai.Tu\u0308rkiye has taken a more vocal moral stance. Ankara consistently defended Palestinian rights in international forums and pushed for a deal that recognizes Palestinian suffering. While Tu\u0308rkiye\u2019s diplomatic leverage over Israel is limited, its role in rallying Muslim solidarity and shaping global opinion cannot be dismissed.The United States, meanwhile, remains the central power broker. Washington\u2019s fingerprints are all over this agreement, from security arrangements to reconstruction oversight. Without US pressure, Israel would likely never have accepted even this limited ceasefire. But Washington\u2019s approach still reflects its old biases: prioritizing \u201cstability\u201d over justice, \u201csecurity\u201d over sovereignty.This triangle of mediation\u2014Tu\u0308rkiye, Egypt, and the US\u2014may have delivered a ceasefire, but whether they can sustain it depends on political will. If any of them waver, the deal could collapse overnight.2\u110b\u1175\u11af(\u1112\u1167\u11ab\u110c\u1175\u1109\u1175\u1100\u1161\u11ab) \u1100\u1161\u110c\u1161\u110c\u1175\u1100\u116e \u1107\u116e\u11a8\u1107\u116e\u110b\u1174 \u110c\u1161\u1107\u1161\u11af\u1105\u1175\u110b\u1161 \u1102\u1161\u11ab\u1106\u1175\u11ab \u110f\u1162\u11b7\u1111\u1173\u110b\u1166\u1109\u1165 \u1111\u1161\u1100\u116c\u1103\u116c\u11ab \u1100\u1165\u11ab\u1106\u116e\u11af\u110b\u1166 \u110b\u1161\u11ac\u110b\u1161 \u110b\u1175\u11bb\u1102\u1173\u11ab \u1111\u1161\u11af\u1105\u1166\u1109\u1173\u1110\u1161\u110b\u1175\u11ab\u110b\u1175\u11ab. (\u110e\u116e\u11af\u110e\u1165: \u1102\u1172\u1109\u1175\u1109\u1173)Israel\u2019s ongoing violationsIsrael\u2019s actions since the announcement of the truce prove why Palestinians remain skeptical. Despite formal commitments, Israeli forces have continued incursions, arrests, and air surveillance over Gaza. Reconstruction materials are blocked at checkpoints. Aid convoys are delayed. The siege remains in effect, strangling the enclave\u2019s economy and testing its people\u2019s patience.The Israeli government has also publicly opposed any significant role for the Palestinian Authority in Gaza\u2019s future governance\u2014undermining even the US-backed plan. And inside Israel, far-right ministers are openly calling for continued \u201csecurity operations\u201d in Gaza, a euphemism for indefinite control.In short, Israel treats the ceasefire as a tactical pause, not a genuine step toward peace. The message to Palestinians is cruelly familiar: the bombs may stop for now, but the occupation continues.Fragile, yet vital for PalestiniansGiven all these flaws, why does this ceasefire still matter?Because for the people of Gaza, it is the only thin thread of hope left. After months of relentless bombardment that killed tens of thousands and displaced nearly everyone, even a fragile peace is a lifeline. It means hospitals can reopen. Children can sleep without the sound of drones overhead. Families can begin to look for missing loved ones.It is also a political window. For the first time in months, Palestinians have an opportunity\u2014however limited\u2014to shape discussions about their own future. A functioning truce allows for reconstruction, for dialogue about governance, and for rebuilding the institutions that Israel and war have shattered.This ceasefire, if protected, could become a bridge toward something more permanent. It could allow Palestinian civil society to regroup, and regional actors to reassert that the path to real peace must go through justice.But if the ceasefire collapses, the humanitarian catastrophe will deepen beyond imagination. Gaza cannot endure another full-scale assault. The world cannot stand by again and watch hospitals turned to rubble, children buried under debris, and international law mocked with impunity.What the world must doThe international community must not treat this ceasefire as an end, but as a beginning. It must ensure that aid reaches those in need, that the blockade is lifted, and that Israel is held accountable for any violations. Gulf states must move from rhetoric to responsibility\u2014putting real money, real pressure, and real diplomacy behind their words.Most importantly, Palestinians themselves must be placed at the center of any political solution. The world has long talked about Gaza, rarely with Gaza. That must change.For this ceasefire to mean anything, it must pave the way for ending the occupation, restoring sovereignty, and ensuring that no child in Gaza ever again grows up under the shadow of war.The bottom lineThis ceasefire is not peace\u2014it is a pause. It is fragile, imperfect, and one-sided in many ways. But it is also a desperately needed moment for survival and reflection.If it holds, Gaza might begin to heal. If it fails, the world will have once again failed the Palestinian people.As a journalist who has covered too many wars, I can only hope that this time, the world will not look away when Israel tests the limits of this truce. Peace cannot exist without justice, and justice cannot exist under occupation.For now, Gaza breathes\u2014but just barely. And whether that breath becomes life again depends not only on politicians and generals, but on all of us who refuse to let the suffering of Palestinians fade into silence.", "country": ["south korea"], "category": ["world"], "pubDate": "2025-11-04 22:00:00", "source_id": "newscj", "source_name": "Newscj"}, "edb4c5ebb6a12f56981580bed8a9cf08": {"link": "https://www.syracuse.com/tv/2025/11/cant-watch-the-lowdown-season-finale-on-youtube-tv-try-these-free-alternatives.html", "title": "Can\u2019t watch \u2018The Lowdown\u2019 season finale on YouTube TV?

The poll shows that one in three Americans under 45 years old believes that political violence is justified.This tracks with other polling that shows that roughly thirty percent of both Democrats and Republicans felt that political violence might be necessary.The rise in support for political violence comes at a time when politicians are increasingly engaging in violent or rage rhetoric.DNC Chair Ken Martin just told MSNBC\u2019s \u201cThe Beat\u201d that \u201cwe may be nearing\u201d the moment when \u201celections don\u2019t matter and then the resistance looks completely different.\u201d Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called on people to \u201cforcefully rise up.\u201dHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., who pictures himself brandishing a baseball bat has previously called upon people to \u201cfight in the streets.\u201dCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom previously declared, \u201cI\u2019m going to punch these sons of bitches in the mouth.\u201dVirginia Democratic gubernatorial nominee Abigail Spanberger called upon her supporters to \u201cLet your rage fuel you.\u201d She then refused to withdraw her support for the Democratic candidate for Attorney General, Jay Jones, who once expressed his desire to kill his political opponents and his children.In his podcast with co-host Al Hunt, James Carville was again spewing unhinged hate. He returned to treating Trump and others as Nazis and their supporters as \u201ccollaborators.\u201d I previously criticized Carville for that analogy. He later attacked me.Doubling down, Carville declared\u201cYou know what we do with collaborators? I think these corporations, my fantasy dream is that this nightmare ends in 2029 and I think we ought to have radical things. I think they all ought to have their heads shaven, they should be put in orange pajamas and they should be marched down Pennsylvania Avenue and the public should be invited to spit on them.\u201dTo be sure that his menacing words were not lost, he then added \u201cThe universities, the corporations, the law firms, all of these collaborators should be shaved, pajamaed and spit on.\u201dThere was no later pushback by his co-host, Hunt, or anyone else associated with the podcast.Notably, going into today\u2019s election, Jay Jones was still leading in the polls despite saying that he wanted to kill political opponents and their children. Democratic voters were clearly not deterred by such rage rhetoric.

We were able to drive occupancy through targeted strategic initiatives and active management, resulting in a sequential increase in closing occupancy to 96.5%.

The 55-year-old actor was spotted smiling for selfies, casually dressed with dark sunglasses, before hopping on his bike \u2014 but there\u2019s more going on beneath the surface than just a sunny day in the Big Apple. Deborra-Lee Furness Plans to Tell Her Side of the Story The twist? Hugh\u2019s estranged wife, Australian actress Deborra-Lee Furness, is reportedly gearing up to publish a raw and revealing \u201cdivorce diary.\u201d After officially filing for divorce last month, ending their 27-year marriage, Deborra-Lee seems ready to share the emotional highs and heartbreaking lows of their split. Sources say she\u2019s been meticulously writing down every detail of this difficult journey, determined to have her voice heard. Once the divorce is legally final, she plans to explore publishing deals that will bring her story to the public. A Heartbreaking Public Statement Sparks Interest Deborra-Lee made headlines with a heartfelt public statement where she spoke openly about her \u201ctraumatic journey of betrayal.\u201d She expressed deep empathy for others going through similar pain and reflected on the spiritual strength that\u2019s helped her cope. Her words were thoughtful and introspective, highlighting the wisdom she\u2019s gained and emphasizing the importance of living with integrity and boundaries after such a profound life change. She closed with the idea that \u201cnone of this is personal,\u201d a message that resonated with many but also hinted at underlying tensions. Behind the Scenes, a Memoir Could Shake Things Up While Deborra-Lee is keeping a calm front publicly, insiders reveal she\u2019s preparing to reclaim her narrative through a brutally honest memoir. This book might dive into the intricacies of the split, including Hugh Jackman\u2019s new relationship with Broadway star Sutton Foster. A source close to Deborra-Lee told New Idea that she \u201cwon\u2019t be silenced\u201d and is committed to sharing her truth, which could include revealing details that fans have only speculated about until now. New Romance and Family Tensions Speaking of Sutton Foster, the 50-year-old Broadway star is reportedly feeling the strain as Hugh tries to bring her into the family fold. Hugh and Deborra-Lee share two adopted children, Oscar, 25, and Ava, 19, and sources say Hugh wants Sutton to bond with them \u2014 but Sutton is cautious about moving too fast. According to insiders, Sutton has asked Hugh to slow things down, especially with important family events like Oscar\u2019s recent birthday and Ava\u2019s upcoming one in July. She seems wary of rushing introductions while the divorce remains unsettled and the atmosphere around the family still feels tense. What Lies Ahead for This High-Profile Split? If Deborra-Lee\u2019s memoir comes to fruition, it will likely be one of the most talked-about celebrity books in recent years. With decades of Hollywood experiences, personal struggles, and a headline-making divorce to unpack, publishers are surely eager for the opportunity. Meanwhile, Hugh Jackman has stayed quiet publicly about the split but reportedly feels \u201cextremely disappointed\u201d by Deborra-Lee\u2019s comments. A source revealed there was an unspoken agreement between them not to air their grievances in public \u2014 a promise that now seems broken, albeit without direct name-calling. Hugh Jackman Continues His New York Stage Run Despite the personal turmoil, Hugh has remained professional and engaged with fans during his New York City theatre stint. His ability to balance public appearances with private challenges shows his dedication to his craft \u2014 even as his personal life plays out in the headlines.Breaking Traditions: Miss Universe Welcomes Married Women and Mothers in a Dazzling DisplayCourt Hears Harrowing Testimony: Miss Universe Finalist Attacked by Jealous Ex-Boyfriend in Violent AssaultMiss Universe Model Daniela Nicola\u0301s Reveals Battle with Cervical Cancer in Heartfelt Social Media PostMitchel Ihezue Takes the Crown at Miss Universe Nigeria 2023, Ready to Shine on the Global StageSheynnis Palacios Makes History: Nicaragua\u2019s First Miss Universe 2023Miss Universe Nigeria Mitchel Ihueze Addresses Marriage Rumors and Age SpeculationsMiss Universe Nigeria Chidimma Adetshina responds to allegations of identity theft during South African Home Affairs probeSouth African Beauty Queen Zozibini Tunzi Appointed as Judge for Miss Universe Vietnam 2024, Celebrated for Her Global ImpactMiss Universe First Runner-Up Chidimma Adetshina Breaks Silence Over CEO Anne Jakrajutatip\u2019s \u201cBlonde and Blue Eyes\u201d Evolution CommentAdele interrupts her performance in Las Vegas to reprimand a security guard for arguing with a fan who was \u201cstanding up\u201d at his seat: Why are you all bothering him\u2019 ?Adele interrupts her performance in Las Vegas to reprimand a security guard for arguing with a fan who was \u201cstanding up\u201d at his seat: Why are you all bothering him\u2019 ?New York Woman Sues Miss America and Miss World Pageants for Disqualifying Contestants with Children in Discriminatory MoveChaos Erupts as Active Shooter Causes Panic in Bangkok Shopping CenterBritish Teacher Arrested for Alleged Sexual Abuse of Young Girls at Prestigious Bangkok SchoolDisturbing Incident Unfolds: Passenger Allegedly Attempts Suicide in Aircraft Lavatory during EVA Air Flight from Bangkok to LondonSwiss Air Launches Privacy Investigation After Crew Members Leak Explicit Video of Couple Engaging in Sex Act on Flight 181 from Bangkok to ZurichInfluencer Mark McCann tracks down and recovers his \u00a3220k Lamborghini in Bangkok years after UK car smuggling gang stole itVictoria Beckham Unveils First Menswear Creation on Husband David Beckham During Knighthood Ceremony at Windsor CastleIn the Wake of Autobiographical Storm: Danny Cipriani and Victoria\u2019s Marriage Faces Turbulence, Illuminating the Struggles Between Public Image Control and the Candid TruthTimothy Olyphant Shines in Bangkok While Filming New TV Series and Shows Off Stylish New Look", "country": ["nigeria"], "category": ["entertainment", "top"], "pubDate": "2025-11-04 21:59:19", "source_id": "tdpelmedia", "source_name": "Event Coverage"}, "91951a59930e83c5e1714bd58b4ea730": {"link": "https://edmontonjournal.com/news/local-news/36-million-lotto-649-winner-alberta", "title": "'Holy cow': Whitecourt man wins $36M on Lotto 6/49 Gold Ball draw", "description": "\"I'd really like to do some good with it.

WIRED reported Tuesday that last month, the FBI acknowledged that when U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement cannot be identified and confirmed as legitimate, it gives license to people to pose as officers and nab people. Such was the case when a man claiming to be a sworn officer marched into a Raleigh, North Carolina, motel room and threatened to deport the woman if she did not have sex with him.In a Bay County, Florida case, a woman unzipped her jacket to show an ICE t-shirt and ordered her ex-boyfriend's wife to come with her. The woman grabbed her and took her to an apartment complex before the victim was finally able to escape. In a New York case, a man claimed he was an immigration officer and \"directed [her] to a nearby stairwell,\" WIRED reported. He then punched her, tried to rape her, and took her cell phone. The police ultimately caught him. In other cases, it's unknown if the attackers were, in fact, ICE agents taking advantage of their position or individuals posing as ICE agents. WIRED said that the FBI's notice encouraged agencies to have their officers \"clearly identify themselves and to cooperate when civilians ask to verify an officer\u2019s identity\u2014including by allowing calls to a local police precinct.\"\u201cEnsure law enforcement personnel adequality [sic] identify themselves during operations and cooperate with individuals who request further verification,\u201d the bulletin said.Federal laws mandate that immigration officers identify themselves and state the reason for an arrest. But in video after video of ICE agents grabbing people in Chicago, Portland and Washington, D.C. agents consistently refuse to identify themselves when bystanders request information. In one Chicago case, ICE pepper-sprayed a crowd of people filming them.

The pilot was relaunched in 2018 at two locations.\u201cFor the pilot, a video conflict analysis was completed in partnership with UBC. The study showed LPIs have resulted in up to 20 per cent reduction in total conflicts between pedestrians and vehicles and up to 60 per cent reduction in high-severity conflicts between pedestrians and vehicles,\u201d a statement from the City said.Due to positive results from the pilot, the City decided to keep the pilot locations and formalize the program.\u201cCurrently, we complete 30 locations per year. To date, we have installed a total of 98 LPIs,\u201d the City added.According to the City of Vancouver, the LPIs allow pedestrians a three to seven-second head start. Other cities that have seen successful results from LPIs include Surrey and New York.Daily Hive Urbanized shared a little bit about some of the changes relating to LPIs in a story last year.LPIs allow pedestrians to enter the crosswalk a few seconds before vehicles are given a green light, which improves their visibility before vehicles have priority to turn right or left.An approved motion specifically directs City staff to increase the number of pedestrian traffic signals, rapid flashing beacons, and zebra markings and double or triple the number of LPI crossings in the 2023-2026 capital plan. It also explores restricting right turns on red lights at LPI-enabled intersections.Have you noticed the change in any other Vancouver neighbourhoods recently?

November brings another Old Age Security payment for taxpayers across the province, and this month's deposit reflects the most recent rate adjustment linked to inflation.OAS payments are managed by Service Canada and provide monthly financial support to Canadians aged 65 and older. These deposits typically arrive during the final week of each month and form a key part of retirement income for millions of seniors.The latest quarterly adjustment took effect in October, which increased OAS amounts to help offset rising living costs. November's payment will reflect those higher rates for the second month in a row.Whether you're already receiving OAS or nearing eligibility, here's what Quebec seniors need to know about November's payment amounts, eligibility, and how the program works.What is Old Age Security?Old Age Security is Canada's main federal pension program for seniors. It pays monthly benefits to eligible residents aged 65 and up, regardless of employment history or past contributions. OAS is separate from the Canada Pension Plan.Most seniors are automatically enrolled, with Service Canada sending a confirmation letter shortly before payments begin.The OAS program also includes additional support for low-income seniors, which may be added on top of the base pension for those who qualify.Who can receive Old Age Security?To qualify for OAS payments, you must:\u2022 Be 65 or older \u2022 Be a Canadian citizen or legal resident at the time your application is approved \u2022 Have lived in Canada for at least 10 years after turning 18If you live outside Canada now, you can still receive OAS if you lived in the country for at least 20 years after turning 18 and were a citizen or legal resident when you left.High-income seniors may have part of their OAS reduced through the OAS recovery tax. For 2025, the clawback begins if your annual income is above $148,541 for those aged 65 to 74, or $154,196 for seniors 75 and older.More about OAS eligibilityHow to apply for OAS paymentsMany Canadians are enrolled in OAS automatically, but not everyone. Most people receive a letter from Service Canada around age 64 that confirms when their payments will begin and outlines their options. If you get this letter, you usually do not need to apply.If you are not enrolled automatically, you will have to submit an application. Payments can begin the month after you turn 65, but you can choose to delay receiving OAS until as late as age 70. Waiting increases the monthly amount for life, since each month of deferral raises your eventual payment.Those who may qualify for linked programs, such as the Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) or other allowances, should know that some of these require a separate application.You can apply for OAS in one of the following ways:\u2022 Online: Through your My Service Canada Account. Have your documents and personal information ready before starting.\u2022 By mail or in person: Fill out the forms for OAS and submit them with the required documents to Service Canada by mail or at a Service Canada office.More about applying for OASHow much is the OAS payment for November?OAS payments are reviewed every January, April, July, and October to help keep pace with inflation. Rates increased by 0.7% this fall.Here are the current maximum monthly OAS amounts:\u2022 Ages 65 to 74: $740.05 \u2022 Ages 75 and over: $814.52These are the maximum amounts. What you receive depends on how long you have lived in Canada. You need 40 years of Canadian residence after age 18 to receive the full amount.More about OAS payment amountsIs OAS taxable?Yes. Old Age Security counts as taxable income in Canada and must be reported at tax time. Service Canada does not automatically withhold taxes, so seniors can request voluntary tax deductions if they prefer smaller tax bills in April.More about OAS and your taxesWhen is the November OAS payment arriving?The next OAS payment will be deposited on Wednesday, November 26, 2025.If you are signed up for direct deposit, it should land in your bank account that day. Cheques may take longer to arrive, and seniors are encouraged to switch to direct deposit to avoid delivery delays.Following November, the final OAS payment of the year will arrive on Monday, December 22, 2025.More about OAS payment dates", "country": ["canada"], "category": ["business"], "pubDate": "2025-11-04 21:50:46", "source_id": "mtlblog", "source_name": "Mtl Blog"}, "2bc406a2a06d9470b57aa8251d937907": {"link": "https://www.themarketsdaily.com/2025/11/04/clearway-energy-nysecwen-announces-earnings-results.html", "title": "Clearway Energy (NYSE:CWEN) Announces Earnings Results", "description": "Clearway Energy (NYSE:CWEN \u2013 Get Free Report) issued its quarterly earnings results on Tuesday.

Kennedy Jr during tense exchange on The View in New York after hosts press her on his political roleWhile Hugh Jackman was busy charming fans outside a New York theatre, where he\u2019s starring in Sexual Misconduct of the Middle Classes, his personal life was stirring up quite the storm back home. The 55-year-old actor was spotted smiling for selfies, casually dressed with dark sunglasses, before hopping on his bike \u2014 but there\u2019s more going on beneath the surface than just a sunny day in the Big Apple. Deborra-Lee Furness Plans to Tell Her Side of the Story The twist? Hugh\u2019s estranged wife, Australian actress Deborra-Lee Furness, is reportedly gearing up to publish a raw and revealing \u201cdivorce diary.\u201d After officially filing for divorce last month, ending their 27-year marriage, Deborra-Lee seems ready to share the emotional highs and heartbreaking lows of their split. Sources say she\u2019s been meticulously writing down every detail of this difficult journey, determined to have her voice heard. Once the divorce is legally final, she plans to explore publishing deals that will bring her story to the public. A Heartbreaking Public Statement Sparks Interest Deborra-Lee made headlines with a heartfelt public statement where she spoke openly about her \u201ctraumatic journey of betrayal.\u201d She expressed deep empathy for others going through similar pain and reflected on the spiritual strength that\u2019s helped her cope. Her words were thoughtful and introspective, highlighting the wisdom she\u2019s gained and emphasizing the importance of living with integrity and boundaries after such a profound life change. She closed with the idea that \u201cnone of this is personal,\u201d a message that resonated with many but also hinted at underlying tensions. Behind the Scenes, a Memoir Could Shake Things Up While Deborra-Lee is keeping a calm front publicly, insiders reveal she\u2019s preparing to reclaim her narrative through a brutally honest memoir. This book might dive into the intricacies of the split, including Hugh Jackman\u2019s new relationship with Broadway star Sutton Foster. A source close to Deborra-Lee told New Idea that she \u201cwon\u2019t be silenced\u201d and is committed to sharing her truth, which could include revealing details that fans have only speculated about until now. New Romance and Family Tensions Speaking of Sutton Foster, the 50-year-old Broadway star is reportedly feeling the strain as Hugh tries to bring her into the family fold. Hugh and Deborra-Lee share two adopted children, Oscar, 25, and Ava, 19, and sources say Hugh wants Sutton to bond with them \u2014 but Sutton is cautious about moving too fast. According to insiders, Sutton has asked Hugh to slow things down, especially with important family events like Oscar\u2019s recent birthday and Ava\u2019s upcoming one in July. She seems wary of rushing introductions while the divorce remains unsettled and the atmosphere around the family still feels tense. What Lies Ahead for This High-Profile Split? If Deborra-Lee\u2019s memoir comes to fruition, it will likely be one of the most talked-about celebrity books in recent years. With decades of Hollywood experiences, personal struggles, and a headline-making divorce to unpack, publishers are surely eager for the opportunity. Meanwhile, Hugh Jackman has stayed quiet publicly about the split but reportedly feels \u201cextremely disappointed\u201d by Deborra-Lee\u2019s comments. A source revealed there was an unspoken agreement between them not to air their grievances in public \u2014 a promise that now seems broken, albeit without direct name-calling. Hugh Jackman Continues His New York Stage Run Despite the personal turmoil, Hugh has remained professional and engaged with fans during his New York City theatre stint.

As for Kin, according to its website Kin Insurance is based in Chicago and Kin Interinsurance has its principal office in St. Petersburg.Among the findings from OIR\u2019s Market Conduct Unit, Kin allegedly failed to provide disclosure statements for both hurricanes and failed to pay or deny claims within 90 days for Hurricane Ian.The findings from regulators contend that in 19.9% of the Ian claims it reviewed, Kin did not include a disclosure statement with the preliminary or partial estimate of damage. And that in 26.9% of the claims reviewed, Kin did not, when providing a payment on a claim that was not the full and final payment, include a disclosure statement.As for Idalia claims, OIR found that in 19.4% of cases Kin also did not include a disclosure statement when providing a payment on a claim that was not the full and final payment.Kin, in a detailed statement from a spokesperson, says that once it was notified of the findings the company worked with OIR to address and correct all of the issues.\u201cThe vast majority of these findings were technical in nature, such as not bolding text that should have been bolded or using disclosure language that did not match the exact required language. A small number of claims exceeded the 90-day processing rule due to delays from third-party vendors,\u201d the spokesperson wrote in the statement.\u201cWe regret the technical discrepancies but are comforted by the fact that none of our errors caused financial harm to our customers, which is the most important factor to Kin.\u201dIn its investigation of Slide, the Market Conduct Unit found that the company used unappointed adjusters and failed to provide disclosure statements for both Hurricanes Ian and Idalia.The finding alleges that after Ian the company did not include disclosure statements when providing preliminary or partial estimate damages in 12.7% of the claims it examined.Investigators also found that in 16.4% of the Ian claims it looked at the company did not include a disclosure statement when providing a payment on a claim that was not the full and final payment.In claims following Idalia, in 12.8% of the claims the unit looked at, Slide used adjusters who were not properly appointed and in 36.9% of the claims examined did not include a disclosure statement when providing a payment on a claim that was not the full and final payment.A spokesperson for Slide says in an email that the company has no further comment.", "country": ["united states of america"], "category": ["business"], "pubDate": "2025-11-04 21:50:00", "source_id": "businessobserverfl", "source_name": "Business Observer"}, "652e35ff9580a3b5ae4a74dc778ef8d0": {"link": "https://www.duluthnewstribune.com/obituaries/obits/betty-jane-doebbeling-nee-stahl-evotzkvbwraxcxf9nhk6", "title": "Betty Jane Doebbeling (nee Stahl)", "description": "On Monday October 27, Betty Doebbeling passed away at the Minnesota Veterans Home in Silver Bay.Betty was a retired nurse, Vietnam Veteran and recipient of the Bronze NoStar.
